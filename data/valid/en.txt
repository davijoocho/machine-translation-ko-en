Even if an export contract is signed, the bank threshold is high, making it difficult to raise funds.
With a wide range of products and diversified markets, it is easy to respond to changes in the economy.
Even if the export goods are manufactured and shipped, the funds are tied up to recover the export price.
It is like a phenomenon in which a proper attack becomes difficult if the defense is unstable in soccer.
They are also quick to resolve their concerns on behalf of large companies that are slow to move.
With the collection of loans from financial institutions added, the company's existence itself is shaken.
Sang-Man Kim, Professor of Department of International Trade at Duksung Women's University, would miss the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup these days.
Until the Kim Young-ran Act was enacted on September 28th, 2016, there were many instances where reporters used parking lots installed by the institutions or local governments that they enter for free.
Kim filed a request with the Yangpyeong County Office in October of last year for the release of information on free regular parking vehicles through the non-profit private organization Citizens' Coalition for Public Reform, where he is the secretariat director.
We registered because there was an office near Yangpyeong-gun office, but we rarely use the county-run parking lot after moving the office not long ago,“ said an official from the news agency.
The data showed that there are 369 free regular parking vehicles in Yangpyeong County Office.
The Citizens' Coalition for Public Reform said, "It cannot but deplore the inconvenience that civil petitioner visiting the Yangpyeong County Office suffer because public assets, which are public parking lots, are unfairly exclusively provided to certain organizations or certain people outside the regulations."
In some cases, some cars were still registered as a free car even if the owner of the car was changed.
The FTC is also planning to review the terms and conditions of Netflix, which has occupied our main rooms and is drawing keen attention as it plans to look into the possibility of unfair practices.
If illegal or harmful content is posted, it will first block the content or cancel the account, notify the members of the reason immediately and allow them to make objections.
Google received consent on the terms and conditions at the same time and was criticized for the concern that customers might agree on the articles without considering their respective contents.
Previously, Google decided to voluntarily correct four clauses: collecting too much personal information, keeping and using contents deleted by members, comprehensive immunity from a service operator's responsibilities, and unfair jurisdiction agreements.
In particular, it is notable that Google accepted the FTC's corrective recommendation at a time when global companies, including overseas travel operators, were reported to the prosecution or filed administrative suits for failing to carry out the FTC's corrective order.
This is because it has far more estrogen, a female hormone, than testosterone, one of the male hormones (Androgen), which is related to male-type hair loss.
Male-type hair loss is caused by testosterone meeting with certain cells in the hair follicles and 5-alpha reducing enzymes present in the sebum gland, which in turn causes the hair to shrink and to get thin, leading to hair loss.
It is called postpartum hair loss, and after this period, it returns to its previous state.
If the affected area is not wide, a steroid is injected into the hair loss area and if it is wide, immunotherapy such as immunodeficiency control and UV treatments may be used.
Female hair loss is more difficult to treat than the male hair loss.
Circular hair loss can be cured well, but it often recur.
Alopecia areata treatment aims to suppress inflammation around the hair follicles.
First of all, compared to men, the cause of hair loss is not clear and there are many variables.
Alopecia is best to manage by lifestyle changes or medications at an early stage.
In particular, as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's visit to Seoul failed and the U.S.-North Korea summit ended without results, a sense of crisis ensued.
They argue that the fact that the 40 percent approval rating has been gained thanks to the opposition's sluggishness and division of the opposition parties, should be kept in mind.
Party leader Hwang Kyo-ahn of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party and floor leader Na Kyung-won rallied his supporters as they competed for extreme right-wing clarity, which analysts say is also increasing the number of supporters of the ruling party supporters.
A lawmaker of the ruling party said, "The more Liberty Korea Party tries to rally its supporters, the more the ruling party's supporters are actively voicing their opinions or taking action."
A lawmaker of the Bareunmirae Party said, "The general view on the Bareunmirae Party is that it is conservative rather than progressive, and even in the last by-election, the Bareunmirae Party has been widely believed to have cut off the votes of Liberty Korea Party."
The fact that the second opposition Bareunmirae Party has failed to speak out as an alternative party and is mired in internal strife also supports the approval ratings of the president and the ruling party.
A series of mobile food products launched by Home and Shopping have been receiving a good response.
As a result of counting sales for two weeks (February 14 to February 28) after the start of the good meal program, the food sales showed 35 percent of growth compared to the same period last year.
When a customer orders an item (only from midnight to 17:00), it will be shipped directly from the producer that day and will be delivered the next day.
The design of the app is made simple so that people in their 40s and 50s, who are major customers of shopping, can use the mobile app comfortably.
A reason why Home & Shopping try to strengthen its food sector is because fresh and processed foods, which have traditionally been sold offline, are rapidly moving into online and mobile markets.
But let's look forward to seeing the performance as we start a joint search today.
As I said, there are hundreds of rescue and search personnel on the scene and we will continue to mobilize all our manpower to search for the missing persons.
I'll explain further when I come up with a concrete plan.
Hundreds of people, including divers, have been dispatched to the scene.
This is a major concern for the search process.
There, almost two people took care of one person.
However, Korea has only been enforced for 10 years.
The faces of the nurses and nursing care workers were so happy.
He said he had feelings that were hard to guard against grief and anger.
In the early stages of the system's introduction, the government is said to have induced the establishment of the nursing institution by persuading that it can make a 15% profit on investment each year.
As far as I know, as the problem has recently become an issue, there has been a complaint that the government is overly restricting when they have come here with their dedication and effort starting from the private sector.
I still can't forget the sight of my grandmother crouching when she reached the end.
The facial expressions showed the pride and self-respectation that these people were responsible for the aging of the elderly.
The structure of violence revealed by the two events will be the tip of the iceberg.
On Twitter, he publicly sent a message to actor Yoo Ah-in saying he was suspected of having a mild case and asking him to visit his hospital.
It is similar to the fact that countless women have been raped due to alcohol and drugs in a club space, but the investigation started due to the fact that a man was physically assaulted.
According to the report, he traveled through Seoul with a large number of drugs, and if this is true, he became a kind of transporter as a licensed doctor who can handle medicines.
Appearing in the media was how Kim Hyun-chul, who runs a hospital in Daegu, came to have a degree of recognition enough to receive patients from all over the country.
A Cheong Wa Dae official explained that Chung Eui-yong, head of the National Security Office, received a report from the foreign ministry and reported it to President Moon face-to-face at his residence.
According to footage released by the Hungarian police, the cruise ship capsized and sank in about seven seconds, as if it were swept away by rapid currents as it hit the ferry.
It is analyzed that there was a huge number of casualties because the river rose and so the current was fast due to the heavy rain that had been falling for several days, and because the tourists were not able to escape from the ship due to the sudden collision.
Survivors said they were not informed of how to deal with the accident before the cruise ship departed, and that the rescue system did not work properly after the accident.
A cruise ship carrying South Korean tourists on a trip to Eastern Europe sank on the Danube River in Budapest, Hungary, at night, on the 29th (local time), killing 7 people and leaving 19 others missing.
President Moon Jae-in spoke on the phone with Hungarian Prime Minister Orbán Viktor the afternoon of that day and called for assistance in dealing smoothly with the rescue of the missing and the collecting of the death.
To accelerate the normalization of Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, which has been injected with taxpayers’ money, the present, as the shipbuilding industry is getting out of stagnation, maybe the right time.
Even violence is concerned due to the discovery of metal pipes and thinner in the union vehicle.
The management counters that even if the headquarters of Korea Shipbuilding and Offshore Engineering is established in Seoul, there will be little change in corporate taxes paid to Ulsan since the headquarters of Hyundai Heavy Industries, a new business firm, is located in Ulsan.
Local political and civil society organizations are concerned about the reduction of corporate tax and the outflow of manpower if the headquarters of Korea Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering, a newly established medium holding company, occurs in Seoul.
In these conditions, public power cannot stand properly.
That is because the projection can be downgraded within the last month's projection in case of the prolonged U.S.-China trade dispute.
"Although growth in the first quarter was sluggish, the extent of sluggish exports and investment will be eased and the growth trend will recover thanks to the government's aggressive fiscal policy," he said, "As prices go up in the second half, we believe that deflation concerns are excessive."
However, economic conditions such as Korean exports and investments are not expected to improve easily in the future, raising the possibility that the Bank of Korea will shift its monetary policy toward relaxation.
At the press conference held on the 8th, Cho raised the need for a rate cut, saying, "The Korean economy is about to worry about too low inflation."
Domestic and foreign institutions, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Korea Development Institute, are adjusting the economic growth forecasts downward for this year, and is advising the Bank of Korea to make a rate cut.
The Monetary Policy Board stressed, saying, "The development situation of the U.S.-China trade dispute, economic and monetary policy changes in major economies, financial and economic conditions in emerging market countries, rising household debt and geopolitical risks, and its impact on domestic growth and prices are carefully examined."
"The growth trend of the domestic economy will not deviate significantly from the forecast path (GDP growth rate of 2.5% this year) in April," the Monetary Policy Board said in its decision on the direction of monetary policy. "However, uncertainties in the forecast route are believed to have increased due to the deepening trade dispute between the US and China."
The Monetary Policy Board also left open the possibility for a change in the monetary policy stance, saying in its May statement, "It is believed that the downside risks to the consumer price growth outlook have increased somewhat."
In September of the same year, Chung also lowered the rate one more time at a meeting in October after offering a minority opinion on the rate cut.
On the same day, the Monetary Policy Committee said that interest rates should be lowered.
As the market showed signs of abnormality, city authorities also took action.
The past affairs committee said, "At the time the prosecution's investigation team would hold him/her legally responsible for the outcome of the fact-finding probe, which led to various limitations, including the civilian member of the investigation team under pressure."
The past affairs committee said that the problem was that the police command, which ordered the crackdown on the sit-in protest, pushed ahead with the entry even though it was aware of the danger of ignition caused by flammable materials in the building.
"Although the key to the investigation was to determine the cause of the fire and to specify who should be held criminally responsible, the Justice was not met during the investigation and trial process as the investigation was not conducted in a balanced manner," the past affairs committee pointed out.
The attorneys headquartered at the special investigation department of the Seoul District Public Prosecutor’s Office have sent 20 evacuees to court with charges of obstruction of official performances and lethal injuries. The police were found with no allegation regarding their actions against the demonstration.
The Prosecution Past History Committee has re-examined the suppression and investigation process of Yongsan tragedy over the past year and six months, but did not find any new conclusions about the cause of a fire, which is the core suspicion.
Domestic economic indicators such as exports and employment are still sluggish.
The situation between the two countries is getting worse, with China poised to confront the U.S. with the suspension of rare earth metal exports as the U.S. raised tariffs on Chinese products and blocked its major telecommunications equipment maker Huawei.
With international organizations and private research institutes lowering their forecasts for Korea's economic growth this year to just above 2% range, the general perception was that raising the benchmark interest rate was virtually impossible.
In a survey of bond-related workers conducted by the Korea Financial Investment Association between the 16th and the 21st, 97% of the respondents (100 people) expected a freeze.
April's export fell by 2.0% compared to the same period last year as semiconductors, the biggest item in Korea's exports, and the Chinese market, the biggest market, faltered.
Another reason for the central bank to hesitate to lower interest rates is that a further cut in the rates with the U.S. could further stimulate the recent surge in the won-dollar exchange rate.
Analysts say at least one to two or three out of the seven members of the Monetary Policy Committee, including Governor Lee, may have suggested a interest rate cut.
The simultaneous decline of the cyclical fluctuation of the coincidence index , which shows the current economic conditions, and the cyclical fluctuation of the leading index, which indicates the future economic conditions, has stopped for the first time in 11 months.
According to the "Industry Activity Trend" report released by the National Statistics Office on the 31st, the circulation index of the companion index, which is an indicator of the current economic situation, recorded 98.5 as of the previous month.
Considering that the average cycle of the economic cycle is 49 months, insides and outsides of the Statistics Korea estimate that the low point of the economy will come sometime in the second half of this year or the first half of next year.
In terms of the economic cycle theory alone, the economy is expected to see an upturn for the time being after the low point, and the Korean economy is expected to have a moment for breathing.
It is noteworthy that this indicator can be seen as a sign that economic flow of Korea, which entered the downturn since the second half of 2017, will hit the lowest point and reverse.
Exactly 100 years ago, British and American diplomats and scholars at the Versailles peace conference on May 30, 1919, had dinner at the Majestic Hotel in Paris, France.
"If the headquarters of the CFR are moved to Youngstown, northeastern Ohio, we will be able to directly face a series of factory closures, crimes and social complaints that sweep through small towns and offer an alternative," the Economist noted.
Instead, two bodies were created to analyze diplomacy and propose foreign policy.
The purpose of the two countries to cooperate in order to promote internationalist value.
Many think tanks have worked for a long time to ensure openness and transparency.
People have the right to have reasonable doubts about the agency's claims or objectivity.
It is as if proponents of Brexit are more skeptical of traditional authority than their opponents.
They are expanding their influence by criticizing or blaming elites who have lost their sense of the times and intellectuals who are blind to political advancement.
But most importantly, the think-tanks have to work on it on their own.
The demand for bright ideas and practical policy proposals soared.
"The Economist," a renowned British weekly magazine, said, "Think tanks that study and offer professional insights beyond any political stance are considering their survival in the 'Post-Fact' era when objective truth is no longer important."
Many elected politicians in Europe have little other interest in the policy ideas that are carefully presented by smartasses, just like President Trump.
Critics point out that the sparkling idea presented by young researchers at think tanks in the past led to political influence, status and, generous donations, but they now changed.
Considering the impact of the Institute for Economic Affairs (IEA) on Prime Minister Thatcher and how much the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) were linked to the Reagan administration, one can see the importance of think tanks at that time.
In Britain, antipathy toward the European Union (EU) and antipathy toward migrants, antipathy toward the capital city of London and the affluent Southeast, and antipathy toward globalization has grown.
Academic research into modern American politics shows that lying demagogues gain appeal by saying that "the political system is defective or unreasonable" against one side of the social divide group.
For autonomous education, education bureaus should be set up in local governments, and education officials should make a rough sketch together and the municipal police system should be settled quickly by piloting it in the city, country, and district.
More important than that is that there are not many director generals who want to run for it in the middle.
It is hoped that the management will be able to utilize it well as the political parties do not differ in opinion when it comes to the agenda related to autonomous decentralization and both ruling and opposition parties agree.
He/she also did not forget to point out that heads of metropolitan and provincial governments, including Park Won-soon, Mayor of Seoul, need to make a big decision to decentralize power between the metropolitan and the local district, which is as important as the decentralization between the central and the local.
In particular, it is a pity that laws that are essential for autonomous decentralization such as the Local Autonomy Act and the Local Collective Transfer Act have not been processed.
While the direction is more important than the speed and I agree with the big framework of the government, I hope that the government will establish a consultative body involving all park-related organizations and residents.
"With the extreme confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties, major agenda on local autonomy and decentralization including the "Proposal of Revision of the Local Autonomy Act" have not been addressed in a significant way," said Seong Jang-hyeon (photo, head of Yongsan-gu office), the chairman of the National Committee of Mayors, Governors, and Ward Chiefs.
The key measures of financial decentralization announced by the central government last year is that it would raise local consumption tax rates by 10%p by 2020 to transfer about 8.4 trillion won in tax revenues to the provinces.
Their identity was confirmed by ID cards.
The government is checking the fingerprints of the remaining five dead people, whose identities have not been identified, and will send an additional fingerprint identification team from the National Police Agency to the site on this day to verify their identities.
Serbian officials have informed the Republic of Korea that they have 14 to 15 divers with extensive search experience looking under riverbeds and banks.
Hungarian authorities will launch an internal search for the hull of the cruise ship that sank in the Danube River while operating with 33 South Koreans aboard, foreign ministry officials said.
Of the seven Koreans who died in the accident, two have been identified so far, as women and women in their 50s.
Officials from the Korean National Police Agency and Marine Accident Inquiry Agency are dispatched to the scene to cooperate with the investigation and check into accident, the ministry said.
The Hungarian Police Agency is currently in charge of the search for missing persons and is also involved in the search and rescue of the Terrorist Agency, the official said.
In particular, it requested active cooperation with Romania, which has a dam in the Danube basin.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has banned its use since 1989, and it was difficult for supervisors to accept the administration of growth hormones to athletes on the WADA's list of banned drugs.
The reason was that documents and actual items were different when entering the country.
Considering the characteristic that secretion peaks before and after the age of 20 and then decrease by about 14 percentage every 10 years, an approach to resupply the growth hormone, which was reduced, to prevent aging seems to stand to reason.
In 2004, which is 15 years after its use was banned, the International Olympic Committee could institute a test for growth hormones in Athens Olympic for the first time.
The accuracy of the isotope test is high, but there is one weakness.
When they injected growth hormones to the elderly of over 60 years old who has lower growth hormones than their peers three times in a week for 6 months, their lean body mass(muscle in other words) increased by 4.7 kilograms and their fat reduced by 3.5 kilograms.
Even if it is measured a high level in the athlete's body, it cannot be distinguished whether it came from outside or secreted from the inside.
When athletes inject growth hormones to improve performance, the 22kDa isotope increases and negative feedback acts to reduce the secretion of growth hormone from the pituitary gland.
Just as Stallone, who trained his body all his life to regain his earliest day, has recently been helped by growth hormones, many senior citizens visit anti-aging hospitals, "return my youth."
As public attention is focused on the sentence, growth hormones, which was something that only parents with short children was interested in, has suddenly become a popular drug.
Because doping tests are usually conducted after the game is over, even if one continued to use somatotropin, one would not get caught in the test if one is caring for a few days before the game.
Contrary to popular belief, growth hormone is not a cure-it-all.
Japan's Internet Bank has the advantage of being able to co-market with affiliates with large distributors and industrial capital in Japan.
The relatively high net profit of the Japanese Internet Bank is due to fewer employees and tangible assets, which can reduce fixed costs such as labor and rent, and the proportion of non-interest income such as commission income is relatively high.
In terms of growth rate, Internet Banks have been found to be growing relatively well, with their combined assets growing 2.2-fold from 2011 to 2017, and their net profit increasing 2.3-fold and employees 1.9-fold.
For example, Internet Banks account for 0.2% of tangible assets, which is lower than existing banks (0.6%), and non-interest income accounts for 56.7% of the total operating profit, which is significantly higher than the existing banks (39.0%).
This is much higher than the existing Japanese banks' total assets increased 1.3 times, net profit 1.3 times, and the number of employees increased 1.0 times.
Korean readers have no choice but to wonder how he/she will see Korea.
Both Vietnamese and Americans refuse to recognize and remember that 700,000 people died in Cambodia and 400,000 in Laos during the war.
This is why the state is desperately trying to monopolize the war-related memories and waging a 'war' against the memories of other countries.
Nguyen's point is that Koreans try to use the power of culture to erase their inhumane acts from memory and package themselves as victims.
This result was wholly contained in "Nothing disappears".
He travels to Vietnam, the United States, South Korea, Cambodia and many other countries related to the Vietnam War over a decade to find out how they remember the war and ask how they should remember it.
"War happens, when a citizen with a limited identity sticks to narrow memories that apply only to his own family, tribe and the state," says Nguyen.
Hungarian divers have reportedly attempted to search underwater to find the missing in the sunken vessel, but they are reportedly experiencing difficulties due to its deep, fast water flow and low water temperatures.
I don't want to say there's no hope, but there's very little chance of finding any survivors, a Hungarian rescue official said in an interview with state television on Thursday.
The rescue authorities identified the location of the Hableány, which sank at the bottom of the Danube, but said it could take several days for the actual lifting due to the bad weather.
The authorities are making all-out efforts to halt the operation of ships and control the access of passers-by to piers near the site of the sinking.
"There are dozens of fire trucks and ambulances lined up all day around the Margit Bridge near the scene," local media reported.
Producers of the film, who were filming near Liberty Bridge, 2km from the accident site, also lighted the river and helped with the rescue work.
Hungary's weather conditions are likely to get worse.
It remains to be rewarding that I had to go sightseeing in this weather.
In the last month, there has been a lot of rain in Hungary, causing the Danube river to swell more than usual.
In order to prevent accidents, a sense of safety on its own is paramount.
A large cruise ship collided with a cruise ship carrying 34 people, including Korean tourists, on the Danube River in Budapest, Hungary in the evening of the 29th (local time), causing many casualties.
The exact cause and circumstances of the accident are expected to be revealed only after more detailed investigation, but it is highly likely that it was a safety accident following bad weather.

He did not, though he knew he would face danger, stop exploring a sequestered country.
At first, the mother did not know who God is, and wished only her son would come back alive.
Those who have a lot of money or a high position will learn humility.
Rather, there are more than 20 times that I left on trips with a will before packing up a backpack, thinking that I might not be able to come back alive.
I will live looking more at the Lord because I have many flaws.
Paul's confession of himself being guilty is when he looks to Jesus who came to earth to save sinners.
When I am the subject such as "I am good", "Because I do well" and "I am", I fall into spiritual cockiness, and I will fall down.
The reason why we put this flaw in the world's finest carpet farsh is to make sure that it's handmade, because we don't want to compete with the perfect workmanship of God.
Intentionally ugly and broken beads are put into intact, unwound beads, which are called "Beads of Soul".
If you show yourself before God's grace, you will have no choice but to confess that you are a sinner and the greatest sinner of all, the monster.
The studio Nestled in the apartment at 143 Green St., was the core of Nam June Paik's video art and the laser work that took a large part in the later works was done.
It was a cheap apartment with rent of less than $100 a month.
Paik Nam-june had the habit of writing the phone number on the wall that the other person who called had said, and even that trace remains intact.
Paik Nam-june himself emphasized that he was always Korean by saying, "I am from Korea, a poor country," but the place that he lived for the longest time throughout his entire life was New York, not Seoul.
Here is the secret story of the birth of Soho's art street in Manhattan.
The statues of the Buddha and bicycles that Paik Nam-june bought from flea or antique markets were stacked.
Almost all of the larger works were produced in this bloom studio.
At the time Kubota Shigeko, the girlfriend of Baek Namjoon, who later became his wife worked as a gobetween to repair the broken relationship between Baek Namjoon and Maciunas and succeeded to arrange a deal on the studio at Mercer street for 12,000 dollars.
Whenever there is a chance, the Ospitales always try to tell junior pilgrims, especially newbies who walk Camino for the first time, more about the mindset that the juniors should have.
It is good for junior pilgrims to understand, even if they do not.
Most of them may have walked early in this camino, and they may have been settle down on this road because they loved it.
The hospitalero, who guarded that place, was hospitalized due to heart problems, and the news of Manjarin Albergue being closed temporarily spread through the community.
The Opitaleos I met seem to have rejected mediocre life.
The representative place is people at the Pilgrims' hostel, Albergue.
In Louistellan, which is a small village in the valley located in a place just before crossing from Leon to Galicia where there is one Albergue, with an uncommon to start.
This walking trail is a place where the pilgrims, who came from a different cultural area, not to only the physical distance, interact with each other.
After returning home from the pilgrimage, the writer's heart is broken for the news of recommended Albergue shut down from online communities home and abroad relatied to Camino.
Without these Ospitalero, the future of Alberge will be unknown.
Rather than shutting down for lack of facilities or other reasons, I believe it probably that one of Hospitalero, who was guarding the palce, had left or died.
By the time to wake up, the music finally began to flow from the speakers.
The essence of the Santiago walking trail is walking alone, but at least starting in the afternoon when the walking ends, there is a cultural exchange among the pilgrims.
We needed to connect the context with new ways and senses.
In fact, I personally had some repulsion on May 18th before that.
However, it was thought that testimonies and data, which could be called fragments of the truth, could be laid out in honest, ethical ways, and people could decide upon them.
I was impressed by the words of those who were in the provincial government on the 27th.
No, I honestly don't know if there was such time before.
Ji Man-won is acting as a speaker, but there were perpetrators behind it.
Since it took 4 years to work on it, we hope we will have enough screening opportunities so that many people can find it in theaters for 4 weeks.
In some cases, people were not well due to torture, but failed to receive proper treatment due to stigma over them as a violent group.
When the healthy DNA of a family community is experienced by a pastoralist, it can be a healthy cell that is built up naturally, not just a cell that exists as a teaching cell or program.
If there are many trained cell leaders, the cell groups naturally reproduce in healthy ways.
When a new believers come in, they should have a system that can spiritually regenerate this soul and quickly nurture them into small group cell leaders.
When the relationship is intimate, students will have a "Cell-Group Discipleship Guide" and discipleship in one-to-one or one-to-one small groups.
When the soul is born again, we must teach how to pray and read the Word so that we can wisely cope with the problems that come in our lives so that we can live victoriously.
If a relationship is formed to some extent, there is a middle group soul invitation event called "Happy Bridge" where you can rent a church or a good place to make a more intimate relationship and access the Gospel.
Only then does this soul not wander and settles on the church.
The reason why we want to do cell church is simply because it is for numerical revival, because something needs to change, or because cell church is God's biblical church.
Because small groups such as territories and nets exist inside the church.
Joel Komiski, a cell church leadership expert, says it takes at least five years to build and transform the cell church, a biblical church community.

The delivery vehicle will be replaced by Ford's self-driving car, while the courier will be replaced by a two-legged robot.
"In the demonstration video, such activities as picking up a box or climbing a staircase were done by remote control, not by robots."
This is not the first time a walking delivery robot has appeared.
According to a demonstration video released by Ford, the delivery of the robot will take place in two stages.
At the heart of this system is the two-legged walking delivery robot Digit, developed by Agility Robotics, which was set up in 2015 by research developers from Oregon State University.
The robot in the back of the car pulls out its arms and legs that were folded and lifts the object.

By 2017, we have offered scholarships to as many students as possible, but in 2018 we have turned to offering the maximum scholarships to a small number of elite students in order to provide practical assistance to students with financial difficulties.
'Presidential Scholarship (a full scholarship given by president of university)', provided to only 7 selected students with best talent and potential among the freshmen of Berkeley School of Music every year, is one step above the 'Full Scholarship'.
"CJ Music Scholarship", awarded by Shin Hyun-kyung, Kwon Da-sol Ha Su-bin and Kwon Hee-ryong, Lee Ju-young, is a scholarship that supports the CJ Cultural Foundation and the Berkeley School of Music give $16,000 each year with being in charge of 1:1.
The 2019 CJ music scholarship candidates for the Berkeley School of Music received application from February to April. Total number of 50 people applied for it and competed fiercely.
The CJ Presidential Scholarship is a scholarship fund sponsored by the CJ Cultural Foundation to support the best student with total amount of up to 320 million won ($268,000) over four years, including full tuition, dormitory fees, and laptop expenses.
The duty-free shop is located between carousel (baggage conveyor belt) number 5 and 6, which meet when you come down to the first floor after completing the immigration review on the second floor.
The stores of Terminal 2, monopolized and operated by the Entas Duty Free, displays alcohol, perfume, chocolate, red ginseng products, Legos and golf products in five to six categories, including cosmetics, liquor, toys and food.
Korean tourists, who had to buy duty-free goods when leaving the country and carry them throughout the trip, can now conveniently go shopping as they enter the country.
Items worth more than $600 were excluded from entry in the first place, and combined items worth more than $600 cannot be paid for.
With the introduction of duty-free shops at the arrival hall, the limit for Koreans to purchase at duty-free shops will be increased to 3,600 dollars from the previous 3,000 dollars, but the scope of duty-free will be up to 600 dollars, the same as the previous one.
Because of the lack of space inside the store, the duty-free shop should be visited before the baggage claim, or if they're a group, baggage can be left and one can go shopping.
This is because the duty-free shop at the arrival venue has a $ 600 purchase limit.
For example, if a person purchases a 600-dollar bag at a downtown duty free shop, 600-dollar clothes from abroad, 600-dollar domestic cosmetics at a duty free shop in the arrivals hall, 600-dollar domestic cosmetics can be deducted as a tax exemption in advance and the rest of them will be taxed.
When travelers go through customs, all the items purchased at oversea and local duty free shops, including the one in the arrivals hall are all added up and then taxed.
The building manager, who heard the woman, said he thought the man was a resident by dialing the number of the upper floor where the woman lived, but he followed her without getting off the floor he pressed.
Additional footage of the so-called Sillim-dong attempted rape CCTV video that was released on the Internet to publicize her damage was revealed.
Additional footage released by the media shows the man trying to open the door in addition to trying to follow the woman.
"The police were also quoted as "police telling the victim to report back to the scene after the victim secured CCTVs and reported the second time," the media said.
The man arrested by the police said he was drunk and he could not remember his behavior at the time, but in the video, the male was standing around the closed door for 10 minutes and attempting to open the door by looking at the door lock with his cell phone flashlight.
The decision has led to an analysis that the United States has refrained from expanding its war.
This is a case in which the trade surplus with the U.S. either exceeds USD 20 billion, or the ratio of the current account surplus exceeds 3% to that of GDP, or the government or central bank's intervention in the foreign exchange market continues for more than 8 months a year.
"If the U.S.-China negotiations reach a compromise, the won-dollar exchange rate is also expected to stabilize downward in the long term," said Moon Jung-hee, a researcher at KB Securities.
In a report, the U.S. Department of Treasury maintained China at the level of "observed" but warned that it has "significant concerns about China's monetary policy in light of the yuan's imbalance against the dollar."
The U.S. Treasury Department has said that it should "take the necessary steps to avoid the ongoing weakening of the yuan" and pointed out to "stop the act of distorting the foreign exchange market."
If negotiations between the U.S. and China escalate into a catastrophe, it is likely that the value of the Chinese yuan will plummet and Korean won which shows signs of coupling with the Chinese yuan will be struck by a "stray bullet".
When the target date is released, it is possible to estimate the expected date of the decision.
The same lawsuit filed by LG Chem in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, separate from the Korean Trade Commission, is expected to take up to three years, reportedly.
The industry interprets that LG Chem's lawsuit is pointing a new battery plant which SK Innovation is building in Georgia, USA.
On the 30th(local time), the US Trade Commission announced on its homepage that they are beginning an investigation on the incident of trespassing confidential business information that LG Chem raised on the 30th of last month.
The investigation will begin as soon as the case is assigned to the judge.
It is also easy to get a newly-wed house as it can avoid regulations on housing such as multiple homeowners and can subscribe without a subscription passbook.
Officetels, which had been locked in the perception of being 'small and uncomfortable,' are drawing new attention as a home for newlyweds, deviating from the existing one-bedroom format and presenting residential designs.
"Ian Gangdong Comhome Stay," which is being sold by Daewoo Industrial Development in Cheonho-dong, Gangdong-gu, Seoul, attracting attention as it is designed to be a double-decker with all types of high-rise buildings.
ePyeonhansesang City Gwacheon, supplied by Daelim Industrial to the members of Byeolyang-dong, Gwacheon City, Gyeonggi, has a neighborhood living facility on the 1st to 3rd floor, enabling a convenient one-stop livelihood in the complex.
On the top floor, private rooftops will be provided, and specialized designs such as dress rooms, high-end lobbies, and exclusive pet parks, which are rare in a studio apartment, are also applied.
Compared to apartments, studio apartments are inexpensive and have the advantage of lowering the cost of purchasing furniture or appliances with their fully furnished system.
Entering Suji-gu, Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, Hyundai Engineering & Construction's residential officetel "Hillstate Water District Office" consists of 75-84 square meters of exclusive area, with "living room+2 rooms" and "living room+3 rooms" structures, depending on the equilibrium.
How upset was the subcontractor, who had to wash down the site that was coal-dusty every day from several days before the field survey to make it seem to be safe.
Listen to that story, I think about how the subcontract workers at the power plant would have felt.
Asked by human rights activists, "Is there anything you really want to say," Kim Yong-kyun's colleague said, "I hope our words have power."
It is that the developers distributed answer sheets in the form of explaining material in the Special Investigative Committee questionnaire and made them wipe with a wet mop before the research secretary conducted an on-the-spot survey.
It was not until Kim Yong-kyun's death that the world listened to their voices, and as a result, "a special committee on the investigation of coal-fired power plants was formed to investigate the late Kim Yong-kyun's death and prevent a recurrence" was composed.
It is because the wall of the workplace is too high that the problem of the site does not adequately come out unless the workers talk about it, and the system is also not appropriately applied.
It is because it is important to not only make sure the investigation is conducted properly, but also to keep the subcontracted workers who have effortfully mustered up courage from being frustrated.
Death is unstoppable if there is no right to field workers.
The government has promised to halve the number of deaths at work and the Industrial Safety and Health Act has also been revised for the first time in 28 years, but it has yet to prevent deaths still.
Citizens who were heartbroken by Kim Yong-kyun's death should also show the strength of solidarity so that their subcontractors can testify confidently, believing in the "power of words."
This is also the reason why more non-regular workers die without rights.
The courage also revealed that the power generation company prevented the investigation of the Special Investigation Committee.
If you make the words of workers lethargic, death continues, no matter how much the system improves.
I agreed to deliver the lecture, as I was in charge of developing the correspondence card for new believers.
Like a fish in water, hundreds of sets of orders were flooded in from each church.
I thought the editorial staff or the accountant had no reason to be impressed with the sample.
It was very busy to print and send beautiful envelopes containing a set of 12 chapters of the new believer communication education postcards of the new believer communication education.
From early that morning, attendees began to gather from all over the country.
As soon as I came to the office the next day, general manager Sung had a bright face.

In the Myeonmok 2-dong garden, brightly dressed mannequins are eye-catching.
Passing through the red, pink, and yellow rose garden, which was painted along the Jungnangcheon Stream in Jungnang-gu, Seoul, you will see another garden in full bloom with canola flowers.
The Seoul Rose Festival, which marks its fifth anniversary this year, has evolved with the participation and cooperation of its residents.
The pop-up garden created in front of the 2nd Yeonyuk Bridge, which runs from Mukhyeon Elementary School in Muk-dong to Jungnangcheon stream is representative.
On the 16th, the student body announced the suspension of the business by announcing that "The statement was posted on the Chung-Ang University petition bulletin board that 'the work of the gender equality committee promotes gender conflicts and only emphasizes the improvement of the women's rights'".
An official at 'Ban' said, "Since the Me Too movement, it is more important than ever to deal with sexual violence in the school, and the Student Council minds some students' anti-feminism, So I am trying to condemn it."
A number of follow-up organizations have been set up since the abolition of the female student council (CF) in universities, but it has been shown that they are also suffering from "backlash."
Yonsei University's school council has also set up a sexual violence committee since the abolition of the female student council, but it has been criticized that it has no concern about preventing secondary damages, such as advocating "presumption of Innocence."
Experts said that after the Me too movement, concerns about sexual violence in the school have increased, but paradoxically, the backlash also strengthened, leading to this conflict.
Park In-bee is one of the most prominent players.
She had a good start, winning the HSBC Women's World Championship in February and finishing runner-up at the Kia Classic in March, but has been on a downward spiral.
"Park In-bi, who won his first youngest age in 2008 (19 years, 11 months and 17 days), won the trophy once in 2013 and was the only Korean player to win this competition twice."
Park Sung-hyun became a famous star when U.S. President Donald Trump left a congratulatory message on Twitter when she won the event two years ago.
There are as many as 99 bunkers in Charleston CC like minefields.
The spontaneity of the congregation can be seen throughout the church.
We were in a time when the church was saving its finances, agonizing over the place of worship for the first year of its pioneer.
Once, members of the church volunteered and put windproof vinyl on the window of a nursery.
Congregation give opinions and do things for society.
Our church does not have many elements that are likely to be common in other churches.
The church, which started with 26 members in a space of 66 square meters (20 pyung) in 2016, has gathered 55 members in two months, and now there are about 450 members attending Sunday worship service.
Pastor Park said, “I came up with the idea that the missionary power of the church is the centrifugal force to the outside rather than the centripetal force to the inside.”
Pastor Park said, “If the Christians find a way to reveal God in their lives, the church helps them.”
The church is used to laying down, but there is one not laying down.
The Christian, who thought he/she needed a gospel, began to pray for him/her.

Since there was no eternal joy, I began to make instruments and sing.
Even today, people are anxious to live alone and build various castles.
When Abraham worshipped according to God's command, the Lord received it and gave the Holy Spirit.
Repentance arose in singing hymns and a change of life appeared after receiving the Holy Spirit.
There are a growing number of people who live by going after ambitions like Noah’s times.
When the Holy Spirit is received, all the people fall before God and worship.
Children and adults stopped playing games and singing popular songs.

Since this is a hospital, tree doctors from all fields are stationed here.
The patients of the botanical hospital can not come to the hospital on foot.
Although its existence is not widely known to the public, Seoul National University's Botanical Hospital was established in 1999 and has been operating for 20 years by this year.
People who have long worked for the health of trees hope more 'scientific' tree care to become universalized in the future.
Four years later from now, the system has been changed so that only those who have obtained certified qualifications as wood doctors can open wood hospitals,“ said Professor Lee Kyung-joon.
When urgent diagnosis is needed, you should cut off the branches and visit the tree diagnostic center by yourself.
As long as the e-suit is convenient, it is necessary to know and use it properly to avoid any loss.
There is one thing that should be very careful about electronic litigation.
Such an electronic litigation has many advantages for both the court and the parties. Today, the number of electronic litigation cases overwhelms the number of paper litigation cases, and even the introduction of electronic litigation is seriously being considered for criminal case.
For example, if the original lawsuit file of June 7, 2019 is delivered, the appeal period is generally until the 21st of the same month, but if it is considered to be delivered due to failure to check on the electronic litigation website, the appeal period is until the 20th of the same month.
In Korea, electronic litigation was first introduced in patent litigation on April 26, 2010, and the scope of electronic litigation gradually expanded, allowing most civil procedures to be carried out by the system on March 23, 2015.
One of the survivors described the critical situation at the time of the accident, saying that a large boat hit the back of the ship while taking pictures and it fell into the river when it overturned in a moment.
Thirty-three Koreans were aboard the ship, including 30 Korean tourists, a travel agent, a local guide, and a photographer, plus two Hungarians, totaling 35 people who were on the ship.
They should come outside through the stairs connecting the upper and lower floors, which is the only way to get out. However, the ship collapsed and sank, effectively blocking the way out.
This accident happened so quickly that many people aboard the cruise ship might not have been able to get out of the ship.
Then let me recap how the accident happened.
Realizing that power was not the same as before, the British formed an English-Japanese alliance with Japan to stop Russia's south in Asia.
As a patriot at the end of Choseon Dynasty Hwang Hyun wrote in the Maecheon Yarok, `` British impressed with the Boer's strong resistance, they kept them alive without killing them. '', Beors distressed British, the strongest power in the world.
In need of funds, Russia overissued the short-term debt and collapsed by itself.
After being manipulated by both sides and ending the war, more serious discrimination came.
The document was intended to filter out communications and account tracking warrants for the judges' families, prosecutors suspect.
An electronic damper, called skyhook, allows sensors to monitor each wheel, body movement, and road surface conditions and automatically adjusts settings accordingly.
As an alternative to the imported car market, which was led by German vehicles, the company recorded the best performance in 2017 by surpassing 2,000 units and sold 1,600 units last year.
Maserati, an Italian luxury car, is running at a frightening pace.
It is lighter and simpler than hydraulic, but fine vehicle control is possible.
The dictionary meaning of this cool borrowed-name is surprisingly simple.
"He was relatively good with one point losing in the first group match against Portugal, which was the favorite to win the title in the match against South Africa, as he kept the goal scoreless despite heavy rain."
The victory was largely attributed to Kim Hyeon-woo's (20, Dinamo Zagreb) heading goal in the second half of the 24th, but without Lee Kwang-yeon's defense it would be impossible.
Korea secured the winning scores of 3 points as they blocked the shoot made by Modise with his head, which was after they blocked the corner kick of the opposing team, during the extra time of the second half in which Korea led by 1-0.
"After 6 minutes, he hit a free kick from the goal, and his opponent's second shot was blocked."
The remaining question is how far the team can minimize its loss in the final match against Argentina, which has the record of winning the most titles (six times).
"The national team, with one win and one loss, was ahead of Portugal-1 in goal difference (0) and ranked second in the group, further increasing its chances of advancing to the round of 16."
In particular, even when the stadium was in bad condition due to heavy rain since the middle of the first half, Lee Gwang-yeon kept his concentration until the end.
The Korean national team won the match against South Africa 1-0 in the second Group F match of the U-20 World Cup at Tich Stadium in Poland on 29 (Korea time).
33 Korean group tourists were aboard the cruise ship that sank off at the Danube river in Budapest, Hungary on the evening of the 29th(local time), among whom 7 were killed, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on the 30th.
The largest number of inland waterway accidents was clashes with bridges and other facilities (36%), followed by the collision between ships (15%).
What attracts attention is that 82 cases, or 12.5% of the 653 accidents in 2013 took place in small cruise ships, such as the Danube River cruise ship capsized with 33 South Koreans on the 29th.
If ships rush in around a famous tourist destination at night when it is hard to identify objects, a big accident like this disaster can recur at any time.
If the level of the river declines, the width of the river narrows, resulting in frequent clashes between ships that could lead to many accidents, and if due to the flood the level of the river increases, large and small accidents occur due to the ship having difficulty coming alongside the pier.
It's because rivers have been regarded as a relatively "safe" route for ships, unlike sea accidents where tidal waves and storms often drive along and stranding accidents happen with weather fluctuations.
Then, "operating programs for a healthy life," "supporting and strengthening resident self-governing activities," "boosting resident lectures" and "archiving of Jongam-dong and Yi Yuk-sa" received residents' support in the order.
Prior to the meeting of residents in Dongseon-dong in Seongbuk-gu held on the 25th, creating a shared kitchen, setting up gobo lighting, taking a picture wishing for longevity for free and setting up a recycling playground were selected as priority projects.
Participants at the residents' general meeting, which was divided at 15 roundtable tables, decided on the priority of the project by mobile voting after hearing explanations of 12 projects selected through the sub-committee after the Jongam-dong Residents' Association received proposals from residents.
If the resident council was a male-oriented organization for men in their 50's and 60's, consisting of representatives and officials of local occupation organizations, the newly formed resident community expanded participation to housewives, young people, and adolescents as well.
As a result of the vote, 34.3% of the respondents said that the "Safety First Jongam-dong" project, which installs fire alarms and gas detectors in vulnerable families, won the highest vote.
The grim reality in the report is that "when you retire, you dream of a start-up or an innovative job, but you end up choosing a company similar to your first job again and repeat resignation and reemployment."
Above all, the statistics that the average period of continuous service of the first job of the young people is only 1 year and 5.9 months and the resigning rate of the college graduate new employee in 1 year is 27.7% shows the seriousness of the issue.
The phenomenon of young people leaving the company is not a bold challenge to an unstable future, but a defensive defense spawned by "excessive obsession with stability."
That feeling of anxiety leads the young man to early leave.
There is a lot of anxiety in the future that even regular workers may be cut off.
The results are based on in-depth interviews of 21 young people who have left the company, which well describes the "structure" in which those young people, who barely got a job, had to leave the company.
Young workers stand in the midst of the polarization of the economy and the chaos of labor norms.
Noisy inside and outside the team's performance was not good.
One season of Maurizio Sarri, who is a coach of English professional football Chelsea, is over
It was widely expected that the final match at the 2018-2019 English Football League Cup in February would be Sarri's last match.
"Many players, including Giorginho and Gonzalo Higuain, who he himself recruited, and David Ruiz and Antonio Luddiger, are still reportedly giving their full support to the coach."
At that time, the goalkeeper Kefa Arisavallaga attended the colostrum.
Sari's term is likely to be extended as they beat Arsenal, who had been a rival in London, England, and won the European Finals.
Under adverse conditions of heavy rain, rescue teams are working on the rescue operation of a cruise ship carrying 33 South Korean group tourists capsized in the Danube River in Budapest, Hungary.
Sotiri Dimpinoudis, a Belgian freelance journalist, released a video taken on Twitter on the 30th (Korea time) near the Budapest Danube River, the site of the accident.
It rained a lot so that the raindrops appeared thick out of the window.
In the dark evening, rescue vehicles including ambulances passed one after another.
On-site footage showing how bad the weather is at the rescue site has been uploaded, causing concerns for many.
As trade conflicts intensify, concerns of global economic downturn have also become more intense.
He pointed out that he did not even consider it in the first place, as it is the Ministry of Justice's policy that they cannot indict the president.
The U.S.-China trade conflict shows no signs of being resolved.
Since then, the major index's fall has also been reduced as interest rates have somewhat reduced the fall.
It was analyzed that it was a move of preparation for China's weaponization of rare earth elements.
The Incheon Metropolitan City held a launching ceremony for the iron fence demolition promoted by the city government on the 8th, on the coastal road of the Namdong Induspark, with around 100 people including Incheon Mayor Park Nam-chun and citizens attending.
Incheon is an open port city, with ports and industrial facilities built 100 years ago, Korea's first modern architecture, and Jogyeji culture remaining in the Incheon harbor and around the Gaehangjang Street in Jung-gu.
Incheon Metropolitan City (Mayor Park Nam-chun) on the 30th announced a major plan to make a leap into the vibrant marine water city of Incheon on the occasion of the Sea Day, May 31st every year.
Incheon Port, which drove industrialization as Korea's leading port of import and export, will also be reborn as a new space filled with people and culture away from the image of industrial facility.
The Incheon City government of the civil election 7th will connect the inner port, which had to be viewed as a security zone, with an open port with historical resources, and will create it as a space where citizens can enjoy marine tourism and culture and where future industries bloom.
Currently, 202 fishing boats, including 92 from Baengnyeongdo Island, 62 from Daecheongdo Island and 45 from Yeonpyeongdo Island, have caught around 4,000 tons of blue crabs, bluefin tuna, shrimps, and sand lance annually, raising 30 billion won in catch.
Until now, there has been a lot of disruptions to fishing activities due to strictly restricted fishing areas since the five West Sea islands is a border area just ahead of the Northern Limit Line (NLL), but the move has allowed fishermen to operate in a wider fishing area.
As the coast guard headquarter moved back to Incheon-si City, each coast guard group located in Incheon-si City such as Central Regional Headquarters Korea Coast Guard and Incheon Coast Guard is now interconnected, thus guarding the safety of the people at the waters off Incheon-si City.
At the end of last year, the Korea Coast Guard, which protects the waters of the five islands in the West Sea, returned to its existing building in Songdo, Incheon, and reopened the Incheon era.
The Maritime Police Agency, which was revived by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries in July 2017, returned to its original office in Songdo, Incheon in consideration of the special characteristics of maritime disasters and western sea security.
The sea path for peace and economy has opened wide, with a new fishing ground opening on the five islands in the West Sea on the inter-Korean peace mood and a green light on the revitalization of the peace and tourism industry in Incheon.
First of all, by 2020, about 75% of the iron fences along the Incheon coast, including ports and new cities, will be removed, and the space where citizens can dip their feet and hands in the sea will be significantly expanded.
The expansion of the fishing grounds on the five islands in the West sea is the first symbolic step related to the real life of the people in the task of resolving the inter-Korean peace era and a change that confirmed the Korean Peninsula peace process contributes to the improvement of the conditions for residents of the five islands in the West Sea.
The expansion of fishing grounds on the five islands in the West Sea was confirmed by the revised safe fishing regulation as a result of close consultation between the government and the private sector together, with Incheon Metropolitan City actively cooperating with the central government for the rights and interests of local fishermen after the April 27 Panmunjom Declaration last year.
In this bus, which runs through city center slower than the average speed of the Seoul City Tour Bus (30 to 40km per hour), time for employees to eat their own meals was prepared in line with its trial run.
While regular restaurants can see the scenery outside the stationary car windows, the main advantage of the bustaurant is that it allows to eat while looking at the ever-changing views of Seoul.
The Myeongdong City Tour Bus stop is where 150 performance teams, including 10 Seoul City street performance teams, will provide visitors with something to see every Thursday (from 12:20 p.m. to 1 p.m.), and Saturday (from 6:00 p.m. to 7:40 p.m.).
The Yellow Balloon City Tour Bus will also hold an event to offer a 50% discount on ticket prices if the temperature rises above 32 degrees Celsius this summer with Seoul as a standard.
At the Gwanghwamun Seoul City Tour Bus stop on the 22nd, there was a red trolley bus that might be seen in the US or Europe.
Existing ticket offices were dark gray like a regular bus stand of intra-city buses and functioned only as ticket sales stands with the tour guide posts attached to the exterior.
The city tour bus ticket office was selected as the first destination for the project to "create fun public space" in Seoul in cooperation with the tourism industry department of the Korea Tourism Bureau and the Culture Headquarters' design policy department.
The name of the bus is Bus-taurant (a compound word of bus and restaurant) and the project was planned by Seoul City Tour Bus so people can enjoy a tour of Seoul with meals from June 1.
The city of Seoul recently launched a design experiment for the ordinary ticket office.
He threw a mockery when Biden announced his candidacy for the presidency by saying, "Sleepy Joe, I hope you have the intelligence to win the election in Democratic Party."
He denounced President Trump's remarks and actions "as part of a pattern that has taken Putin's words at face value and embraced dictators, including the exchange of love letters with Kim Jong-un in Helsinki."
It is a counterattack, citing that Biden denounced Trump administration's foreign and immigration policies at a security meeting in Munich, Germany.
The controversy was triggered by Biden's remarks during his Philadelphia campaign on the 18th that "President Trump embraced 'tyrant' Chairman Kim Jong-un."
"It's really funny that the criticism came from the lips of Joe Biden, who attacked the president on foreign land in February," spokesman Tim Muto said in a Twitter post.
On March 1, a hundred years ago, the cry of "Long Live Korea Independence" echoed at Topgol Park in Seoul, was heard again four days later in a small hill in Gooam-dong, Gunsan, North Jeolla Province.
On the 334-3rd of Gumam-dong, Gunsan, sculptures such as the Gooam Church (publisher Kim Young-man) and the mural and monument depicting the Mansei movement were erected along 200 meters of gentle uphill road.
As you reach the top of the mountain, you can see a three-story building with modern architecture.
The faith and national spirit that Missionary Junkin instilled in the saints in Gunsan region were the driving forces behind the independence movement that was on the verge of collapse.
In 1919, Kim Byeong-soo, then a graduate of Yeongmyeong School and a student at the Severance Medical Center, was appointed as the liaison officer in Gunsan by Deacon Lee Gap-sung (Namdaemun Church), one of 33 ethnic Korean representatives.
It caused 53 deaths, 72 injuries and 195 imprisoned victims, but it has become a trigger for the spread of the independence movement across the Jeolla and Chungcheong provinces.
Pastor Kim Young-man, who guided the memorial hall, said, "The Gunsan March 5th independence movement could happen because there were blue-eyed missionaries who sowed seeds of the gospel."
In December 1899, when Gunsan opened, he decided to set up a missionary base in Gooam Dongsan and set up the Gooam Church, Jesus Hospital, Yeongmyeong School and Melbondin Girls' School.
Shim explained that the students who were preparing for the middle school graduation exam at that time took to the streets fiercely against the Japanese bullet, shouting, "Let's graduate after independence."
Through this, it is expected that the private sector and local governments will join forces to become a new center for research on space technology that both of them participate together in the international space exploration field.
Therefore, Incheon Metropolitan City Government is confident that it will blossom space science and technology, including space exploration, and the two agencies will work together to prepare it step by step.
He also proposed participating in the ISRU (In-situ Resource Utilization) program, which was agreed to jointly study with NASA Langley Research Center last year, as well as exploring space with the goal of 2024, when full-fledged space exploration is expected to begin.
Inha University will join hands with Norfolk State University of the U.S. in space exploration with NASA's Langley Research Institute to prepare for the era of space exploration.
It is making efforts to promote the industrial-academic convergence center, a research-oriented campus with the Incheon Metropolitan Government and related companies, and later, Songdo campus, which is centered on specialized graduate schools, as Korean-style mecca for space science and technology in the metropolitan area.
It has already discussed with the NSU the participation of the U.S. Embassy in this meeting and the preparation of a meeting in the second half of this year with members of the U.S. Congress, the Virginia regional government and Korean lawmakers and the Incheon Metropolitan Government.
The move follows criticism that Japan's introduction of ships that have been used for more than 18 years and operating them after modifications caused the disaster.
The shipping company of the cruise ship Hublaini, which sank while carrying South Korean tourists in the Danube River in Budapest, Hungary said there was no problem with the ship itself.
The shipping company said there was no problem, but Hubbleani was a ship that should have been scrapped if it were for South Korea.
The measure was put forward by the Ministry of Public Administration and Security to strengthen safety standards after the Sewol ferry disaster.
According to Reuters, Hableany is a 27-meter-long and two-story cruise ship that was built in 1949 in the former Soviet Union and is a 70-year old ship this year.
In this situation, Japan believed that if the U.S. suddenly cut off its raw materials, it could invade resource-rich Southeast Asian countries.
Bloomberg columnist James Gibney pointed out that "if the United States and China pursue peaceful coexistence, the history of the United States and Japan just before World War II is worth savoring."
Japan's purpose was to take away the land of Southeast Asia occupied by Britain and the Netherlands.
Japan felt the time was tight, and the voices of anti-American hardliners grew rapidly.
In this context, Dean Acheson, who later becomes Secretary of State, intervened.
When Japan bombed the Chinese city, the U.S. State Department urged airplane manufacturers in June 1938 "not to sell planes to countries that bomb civilians."
The possibility of a policy accident with fatal consequences is too great.
The U.S. and China's all-round strategic competition has historically been similar.
The purpose for pre-occupying a favorable position in the re-election seems large.
The U.S. has been strict in its stance as a condition to put embargo on hold.
When the water came to the point of dripping, one shook the body to shake off the water.
After the curtain was set, the weather was so cool that there was a man lying in the sun, but on a hot day, they laid down under the curtain.
After many twists and turns, including the tied parts, untied and the pig taking the tie that I missed, I hung the blackout curtain at last.
Near the house, azaleas are the first to bloom, followed by Chinese wild peach.
We have prepared a powerful electric drill and a drill for drilling iron.
Making shade is a role that prevents the body temperature from rising by covering the sun, and active methods were needed to cool the body warmed by hot air.
It took almost a day just to drill a total of 24 holes.
Because the drill bit was about 10,000 won per one so I thought it would work well, but the size of the hole was about 10mm, so it was not easy.
In particular, some have raised doubts about whether the Financial Services Commission wants to grow more Internet banks to cover the allegations that it prefered K Bank.
Last year when the ruling party opened the way for industrial capital to participate in Internet Banks, the Democratic Party voiced opposition.
KT, the largest shareholder of K-Bank, is being braked in the screening of the shareholders' eligibility to block large-scale capital increase and lead to a series of financial crisis such as prolonged loan suspension.
At that time, the Financial Services Commission was suspected of granting preferential approval by allowing shareholders to participate by lowering Woori Bank's BIS equity capital ratio, which is a major shareholder of K-Bank.
The financial authorities' responsibility, which Lawmaker Park claims, is largely attributable to allegations of the preferential listing to Samsung Biologics and management oversight of some accounting firms' bungled accounting reports.
Although it was in May last year that Lawmaker Park raised the issue of the Financial Services Commission's responsibility for the Samsung Biologics' scandal, the atmosphere made with Financial Services Commission's efforts to hold back has recently changed due to the prosecution's investigation of Samsung Biologics.
On top of that, calls for the Financial Services Commission to take the responsibility are gaining momentum as the prosecution's investigation into Samsung Biologics' accounting fraud take a speed, and K-Bank, the No. 1 Internet bank, is facing a serious crisis.
Amid the Financial Services Commission and Democratic Party of Korea say they will hold an emergency meeting at the National Assembly in the morning on the 30th to discuss follow-up measures but no particular solution is visible, there comes a claim that financial authorities should take the responsibility.
The content greed is endless even though he is the owner of Marvel, the world's leading producer of superheroes, in addition to ABC, a leading North American broadcaster and the sports specialty channel ESPN.
The question is if Korean content can survive despite its lack of capital and content power.
Bob Eiger, chief executive officer of Disney, recently stressed, "We will continue to provide consumers with incredible content, and he won’t be able to take his eye off."
Destructive power is expected to be significant as it can use its smart devices sold worldwide such as iPhone and iPad as a platform.
The Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu come after it.
There are already fierce market battles in the U.S. and abroad.
It is also positive that global OTTs are likely to actively encourage local contents to secure original contents.
In particular, it is necessary to utilize Korean Wave contents that have proven competitive edge.
As telecommunication technologies are developing, markets for broadcasting and contents are undergoing changes that are centered on OTT.
It will be the largest OTT company in Korea in terms of the number of subscribers.
Through many foreign lands, they lose their identity as the people of the Creator God.
He blessed not only Abraham, but also he gave the word of the covenant to all nations to be blessed through him.
Atheist, who believes that 'there is no God at all,' or the Agnostic, who says 'do not even know if God exists or not,' can not know the existence of God because they don't even try.
It is also of missionary importance to us today to examine how God speaks of his relationship with other gods.
God appeared to Abraham and promised, "I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, and you will be a blessing (Genesis 12: 2)."
God wanted to proclaim this to the Gentiles through the people of Israel.
In other respects, God called Abraham, a special man, but in the end there was the grace of God's universal salvation that would bless all nations.
If it is not possible to reach salvation through any god other than God, "religious pluralism" will lose its place.
It is logically contradictory if a creature is saved through a creature.
It was a fundamental religious question of who they were and what they should do.
After ranking challenger in solo rank, he became interested.
Although the game was reversed, it was left on Kang's mind that he made the first scratch at Jung Ji-hoon, who was like a adamant at the time.
Myeong-gu Kang hopes that Hanwha Life's strong teamwork will be maintained as much as winning.
I don't want to change positions like some of the players, even if they lose their talent.
The second chance to become a professional gamer was in Anarchy.
Director Kang, who is aiming for a team with good teamwork, emphasized that "not a team that relies on one or two players, but I want to create a harmonious team that makes the whole team called 'S-class'."
Ironically, I haven't stepped abroad stage since my first debut at the 2016 Intel Extreme Masters (IEM) World Championship.
It is easy for ordinary people to think that they are ordinary, but there are some distortions.
Developed by Japanese game company Square Enix Co., Ltd., "SINoALICE" is a dark fantasy RPG that reinterprets Eastern and Western fairy tales in Director Yoko Taro's unique world view.
"SINoALICE" gained huge popularity as it ranked No.1 in sales at Apple's App Store in Japan with its charming illustration and high-quality story.
At the event, Song Ho-joon, the deputy director of the mobile business division, and Maeda Shogo, a producer of POKELABO, a developer of "SINoALICE", and the original creator appeared on the stage to introduce the game's "unique competitiveness."
I decided that Korean fans will love the unique world view.
In Jeonggeo Village, murals made of scallops' shells attract attention.
If you get to the top of Guksabong Peak, you will see a beautiful scenery at a glance.
The sea and mudflats coexist, and it is convenient to go into the island by car.
Podginji, gunpowderhouse and military police building testify to the painful history.
With abundant purple flowers and crops, it is a wooden bridge called Purple Bridge.
The still landscape of the village seems that time has stopped.
In the case of the Simripo Beach, the Incheon International Airport and the Incheon Bridge are impressive beyond the horizon.
The Bungae Beach, packed with pine trees, is crowded with family tourists in the summer.
In this situation, the re-assertion of the Acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan's claim that the Security Council resolution was violated has been accepted as a revolt against President Trump.
It remains uncertain how President Trump will accept it.
As Bolton's remarks became controversial on the 25th, President Trump publicly refuted them through tweets on the 26th and comments just after the U.S.-Japan summit on the 27th.
The Trump administration's unstable policy for North Korea is rapidly rising to the surface as North Korea's missile launch, which took place after the collapse of the U.S.-North Korea talks.
"I would like to reiterate my comment yesterday that entire North Korea's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) program violates UN sanctions," said he. And he added, "The focus of the Department of State is to remove all (North Korea's) threats."
Many predict that the normalization of the National Assembly will be further delayed as the Liberty Korea Party has stepped up its offensive level instead of apologizing for its member Kang Hyo-sang's leak of telephone conversations between the leaders of South Korea and the U.S.
Regarding the fact that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs filed criminal charges against lawmaker Kang the previous day, he/she denounced, "It is a ploy to cover up their own diplomatic incompetence and mistakes."
In the morning, floor leader Na held a meeting to follow up on the damage caused by forest fires in Gangwon Province, but as all officials from related agencies, including the Ministry of Public Administration and Security and the Korea Electric Power Corp., were absent, she said, "The Blue House and the Democratic Party told all of them not to attend."
A senior lawmaker pointed out that the current ruling party does not seem to feel such a sense of responsibility yet, although it is a loss to the government and the ruling party if the bill on people's livelihood is not dealt with due to the parliamentary conflicts.
Despite this voice, the Liberty Korea Party leadership reaffirmed its position that "if the ruling party does not withdraw the fast track (bill to be handled swiftly) and apologize, there will be no return to parliament."
The current 'Act on the Consumer Protection in Electronic Commerce' allows sanctions such as penalties and suspensions when false or exaggerated advertisements or rejected refunds occur during online sales.
The Imvely incident was also triggered by the failure of properly following the procedures on returns and refunds, although there was a problem with the pumpkin juice sold by Lim.
The current law forces the report of the business if it exceeds a certain level(20 transactions in the last 6 months, 12 million won in size) but it is impossible for the government to exactly grasp the number of transactions that occur in an individual's SNS account.
Since there is no proper means, both the government and SNS platform operators are agonizing over "SNS Market" and "Influencer Marketing."
As the number of regular customers increases, they are also introducing their own products with production plants.
There are legislation pending in the National Assembly that reflect these different positions.
It is a debate opposing the expanded law of the company inheritance deduction, which governor of Barunmirae Party Kim Gwan-young, who belonged to the Democratic Party of Korea at that time, appealed at the plenary session of the National Assembly on December 2nd, 2014.
Even within the Democratic Party of Korea, there are congresspeople who oppose expansion of the system.
In the beginning, the companies that were deducted were limited to SMEs. In 2013, midsize companies with sales of less than 200 billion won were added, and in 2014, they were expanded to midsize companies with less than 300 billion won.
There is a scene that comes to mind when you look at the recent debate over the expansion of "family business inheritance deduction", which deducts inheritance tax if certain conditions are met when family business is inherited.
It was unusual for a bill submitted to the plenary session to be rejected by an objection debate.
If the inheritance tax is deducted, the heir must remain in business for 10 years.
The key content was to ease the criteria of companies that receive inheritance tax deductions when inheriting family businesses from "less than 300 billion won in sales" to "less than 500 billion won."
Very much the Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun government 10 years after another what the truth and truth have been made, but also talk that I'm really is no good.
As a result, Park denied the pro-democracy movement itself and claimed that there was a rumor of North Korean military intervention, but the relationship failed to be corrected.
The problem is that how representative Hwang went through the ordeal gained focus on while the reason remains unexplained.
In the case of Kwon Tae-oh, the former lieutenant general, his capability of "military operation" during his military service was questioned for his non-expertise aspect with fact-checking.
I'm not talking about opinion polls anymore.
In particular, some argue that the contents of contracts are modified to suit broadcasters and producers and that the contract period can be used as a basis for firing at any time.
"If the 52-hour workweek system for regular employees of broadcasting stations is implemented in earnest starting in July, it will likely lead to heavy tasks on freelancers," the Scenarist Division said. It also argued, "In the end, it will lead to the mass production of non-regular workers and freelancers due to lack of manpower."
According to a survey, "2019 Inspection Report on Scenarists' Work Conditions" conducted on 580 scenarists, by the Scenarist Division, 93.4% (542 scenarists) are employed as freelancers, but 72.4% (420 scenarists) of them work full-time at broadcasting companies.
In fact, the Scenarists' Union conducted a survey of 317 job openings on the bulletin board of a broadcasting company's association of writers from March 1 to the 27th of the last month, and only 20 cases looking for part-time workers or open-collar workers were reported.
It is the point of broadcasting writers that it is not highly effective as it only stopped at recommendation.
If the cyber and IT industries, which had been divided separately with machinery and shipbuilding, are combined and fused with physical (manufacturing), a change close to revolution will occur.
The chief of innovation headquarters is to oversee and coordinate research and development across the country.
There were many demands for the increase of essential research funds and autonomy that researchers would come to the national petition before and after the inauguration of the current government.
Now that you have a proper direction and shape, it is time to fill in the content.
Some believe that the Ministry of Science and ICT passed it on to researchers, but researchers who were motivated but thirsty said that it was a good opportunity.
Unlike public corporations, which have their own sources of income and must have publicity, government funded institutes should be based on excellence and not the same criterion.
The reorganization of Park PBS is an issue that researchers have been interested in.
In the meantime, the emphasis on economic efficiency and management evaluation has made it difficult for researchers.
According to the analysis of the government research funds during the time of Democratic Party of Korea governor Moon, unlike the announcement of government that 30% of the research funds are provided to the necessary research, the primary research funds that got directly supplied to the researchers were only 1.2 trillion won.
Every churyeonyeon pibieseu according to their role in rates may be different.
The focus of the Moon researchers is where researchers of a government-funded research institute link the institutional mission(goal) with the federal purpose and allow thinking about it by themselves.
For the past two years, the cast has been establishing the 'Role and Responsibility (R&R) of Government-Funded Research Institute' plan, with the goal of representing the execute research for the country differently from companies and universities.
Just as the head of Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy takes care of trade-related issues of each ministry at a Cabinet meeting, the head of innovation headquarters will also attend a Cabinet meeting to coordinate research and development needed for people's living.
The reason why there was a sense of resistance when the governments before Park emphasized nanotechnology and green technology was due to the tipping effect of the research funds.
The policy to resolve these accumulated complaints is researcher-centered R & D.
They thought that traditional industries would be eliminated and new industries would be relegated to them.
The evaluation based on management evaluation led to problems such as non-regular workers.
The council deliberated each department's R & D budget in June, and agreed to set up a process for review by the council once again this year.
Because there was a time during the Roh Moo-hyun government when they emphasized Bio and hydrogen economy, but Bio collapsed due to the Hwang Woo-seok scandal, and the hydrogen economy fell into disuse, there is a sense of deja vu.
Once you have researched and developed the core technology, you should have the opportunity to conduct follow-up research with the company.
He has been an expert in consumer safety for over 30 years.
She asked her to put the detergent before her mother intercepted.
This was because the medical staff could pull the detergent out of her lungs.
Most of all, it happens so often that young children and older people with dementia mistakenly try to eat it like candy.
Although they did not rule out the possibility of future changes, the industry and regulators have not announced any plans to intervene more actively in safety issues.
Proponents said the bill would be withdrawn if companies voluntarily beef up their safety.
BELLA MANCILLAS is standing on her hands.
Six years ago, when Bella was two years old, she was taken to the emergency room.
The estimated damage is due to last her lungs.
In response to a request for more detailed information about the study, the company presented two studies conducted by the Cincinnati's Drug & Poison Information Center.
As the toxic control center started to witness the increasing number of serious damage by the detergent capsules, it is evident that these rules are no longer effective.
That day his wife, Darlene, left a bag of Tide Pods and some groceries at home, and went out to buy some more.
Consumer protection groups pointed out that injuries have not decreased enough, but the industry was convinced that the group's approach was working.
Schulte says, "The main reason for not many lawsuits against capsules makers is that most lawyers do not know the dangers of their products."
Aravella Simotas recalls a surprise a few years ago when she saw her then one-year-old daughter pick up Tide Pods that fell on the floor.
Indeed, the colorful swirl pattern, which critics point out, looks like candy, is still maintained as a trend in cube-type detergents.
According to a market research company Euromonitor International, sales of products increased by 136% from 2013 (a year after liquid capsule detergent was introduced to the U.S. market) to 2018.
When she first saw the capsules detergents which had been just released as portable, highly concentrated ones, she thought it was a useful and convenient product.
Denis's autopsy report said he suffocated by eating capsules.
Injuries related to laundry detergents spiked shortly after the release of capsule products.
Especially the color, size and feel of the products.
As in rare cases like Bella, long-term complications can persist.
It is also premature to say that individual lawsuits can produce more noticeable results than government regulations.
Mariana Brussoni, a child psychologist at the Research Institute of British Columbia Children's Hospital, said, "Tide Pod, with its unique design, is the ideal product to attract toddlers who are just learning to walk."
This is because there is a slim chance that Senators, who are skeptical about regulations, will approve the capsule tax bill and president Trump, who promised to ease the regulatory burden on companies, will sign it.
Ryan, head of the Louisiana Toxic Control Center, instructed his staff who had received the report to "immediately follow up with proper treatment within 5-10 minutes after symptoms occur and to track and examine respiratory problems."
At that time, Katie did not know if her daughter would wake up again.
Specifically, provisions included applying packaging that children cannot easily open and components that give a bitter taste to the outside shell of capsule detergent.
Darlene called 911, but the emergency rescuers couldn't save Denis.
If support for living expenses is cut off, even Junsu's massage may have to be stopped.
The goal is to cure Jun-su's epilepsy and burn wounds.
Jun-su slipped into a habit of scratching his skin while sleeping, without realizing.
Thankfully, among the hospital fee of 70 million won for the 3 people, the excess fee worth 22 million were paid with the support, but the issue from this point on is the cost for future treatments and restoration surgeries.
The red scar spread from fingers to just below the wrist.
Massage plays a role in preventing the burn spot from becoming hard or large.
Lee needs surgery to rebuild his left hand, which keeps getting hard.
There were also supporters who left messages of support at Save the Children such as, ”I hope that little helps gather to help children so that they can trust the world and come out again.”
Tears are comin up just by thinking of the youngest daughter, but he/she knows that priority is to make sure that the rest of children overcome this crisis.
The father had two skin transplants surgery and the mother had once, but the red and darkened skin was still swollen.
While father Lee was filling the stove with oil, the oil just splashed on the stove, and the flame was carried to a foam block that had been attached to the wall for insulation.
I thought It was just a little slow-speaking when I was a kid, but it wasn't.
A moisturizing ointment costs 90,000 won a bottle, massage oil costs 100,000 won a bottle, and a special bandage attached to the burn wound area is 140,000 won a piece.
The foam block, which is made of styrofoam, began to melt as soon as the flames touched it and even spewed toxic gas.
Even if smoke comes out of the rice cooker, they are afraid of the fire at night.
There is no mother bird to take care of young sparrows.
The monk said a word, smiling like a breezy wind.
Last month, I was lucky to take the opportunity to taste the food he prepared.
A mixture of glutinous and non-glutinous rice runs over Toona Sinensis greens.
It looked like a small hammer, but I couldn't figure out what it was.
Wind-like people who do not stay in one place are monks.
"The food one eats is their body as it is their personality," he says. A simple recipe takes as few steps as possible and needs as less seasoning as possible too, It is the starting point for simple life.
A Buddha tasted it and spoke in aweful eyes.
Sungkyunkwan University, Ewha Womans University, and Sookmyung Women's University have higher acceptance rates for students who major in the fields of humanities.
Including major universities, the number of students passed the four-year college, a total of 207 students were admitted to four-year colleges, with 112 occasional admission applicants and 95 students taking part in regular exams.
Although among successful applicants of the rolling admission the number of those who pass the essay test is gradually decreasing, the ratio of those accounts for 32 percent, which means that students are steadily preparing for essay writing.
Seoul National University and Yonsei University had higher numbers of successful applicants in the science and engineering categories, but Korea University and Sogang University had similar numbers of successful applicants on both categories.
Three students went to Seoul National University, five to Yonsei University, ten to Korea University and Sogang University respectively, seven to Sungkyunkwan University, sixteen to Ewha Womans University, four each to Kyung Hee University and Chung-Ang University, and five to Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.
The global economy will suffer losses amounting to KRW 711 trillion if the trade war between the U.S. and China continues to escalate into an all-out war, with the U.S.-China trade war taking the form of a competition for technology hegemony in the tariff war.
Among them, South Korea, Taiwan, and Malaysia are expected to take damage the most, which are heavily dependent on exports to China.
The amount is from an estimate of the impact on the global economy at a time of peak negative effects, reflecting not only the drop in trade due to tariff barriers but also the sluggish stock market and weak consumption and investment.
First, when the U.S. and China put 25% tariffs on the entire trade, China was expected to suffer 0.8%, the U.S. 0.5% and the world 0.5% loss of GDP.
Analysts say that these countries, which have deeply established themselves in Asia's export supply chain, could be hit mainly in the area of computer, electrical, and electronic products.
He predicted that the U.S. high-rate tariffs on China can raise the U.S. core inflation rate by 0.5 percent over the next 12 months.
In this process, it was revealed that third countries which will receive biggest loss when export to US by China decreases will be Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand in order.
This can be interpreted as saying that it is not easy to narrow the gap between principle and practical application.
The evaluation is that the vice minister's personnel are organized based on the advancement of the officials of the relevant ministries and that the fact that the personnel was formed by changing the positions of the existing personnel rather than recruiting new members is also related to this.
The move is interpreted as an attempt to emphasize the president's consideration for his former aides as well as natural changes for continuity of work, not replacement of his staff.
They are considered figures who have ties to President Moon before and after the inauguration of the government and whose ability to work is strongly trusted by the president.
The possiblity that Senior Secretary for Civil Affairs Cho Kuk, who had been a target from the opposition parties along with the Senior Secretary for personnel affairs whenever there was a controversy over the personnel varification, could be a longest Senior Secretary of Cheong Wa Dae under the Moon Jae-in government.
Regarding the 7 verification standards announced by Cheong Wa Dae, however, a key presidential official said, "If there is a shortfall, we will make up for it more carefully, but there is nothing new to announce."
It is predicted that a similar flow will occur in the process of replacing the Cabinet and the Cheong Wa Dae advisory staff at the time of the general election.
Cho has already been over two years, and President Moon has publicly expressed his position that he wants the senior secretary for civil affairs to complete the role of institutionalizing power agencies.
Coupang has already fallen into capital erosion once in the past.
Softbank does not need to own all the data.
As mentioned earlier, investments are often made in anticipation of future profits.
At first glance it sounds like an absurd claim, but it is not.
Amid growing public curiosity, Coupang still maintains that "it is difficult to disclose the contents of its data-related business to the public," while neither positive nor negative.
As Chairman Sohn Jung-eun is a General Partner (GP) of SVF, his remarks that he will support the project more strongly are interpreted as meaning that the company will continue to invest in Coupang for a considerable period of time.
Coupang's data value can be significant in SVF.
In general, investments are often made in the hope of future returns.
Fact that South Korean distribution businesses are "operating offices globally to secure competent developers" is hard to understand without considering the data background described earlier.
Ritz was introduced in 2001 when the foreign exchange crisis swept our economy.
It is an indirect investment method in which one receives dividends depending on Ritz's profits, and its features are that it divides more than 90% of profits(50% in the case of self-managed Ritz with full-time employees such as asset management professionals) twice a year.
The government expects REITs to grow as an alternative to the dangerous situation in which a large number of people are engrossed in buying and selling real estate for wealth growth.
In 2014~2016, when the construction stimulus and supply expansion formed mainly, the purchase right resales transactions were reached 360,000 cases per year.
Because the dividend through Ritz is similar to the landlord getting a monthly rent, it also considered as an alternative investment for the security for the aged baby-boomer generation whose retirement is approaching.
At least the students who have chosen to come to our school have already chosen what they want to do in the middle school.
About 30 students out of 80 students choose entertainment activities, and about 30 students enter the departments related to Department of Practical Music, and there are 10 students each taking the next year exam and 10 each entering to other general departments.
All of these are the strengths of Hanlim Art School, where students can experience a variety of popular arts.
There are also many students who are interested in composing music.
While natural talent is important for students' development, their passion for it comes first.
"It is the role of the school to develop the competence of students who are currently slightly underperforming but have great potential for development," he says.
Many students rediscover their talents in regular classes with various experiences, while students in Practical Music Departments learning to act or dance, and students in Entertainment Department learning to sing.
Again, these students are actively making their steps toward their dreams and goals, and they are still doing their part in their own field, which they love to.
The second-highest competition rate was made at Hanyang University (Erica), Major of Practical Music and Vocal Studies, with 1,910 people applying for the 4 openings, reaching 478:1 (441:1 in the previous year).
The life bound to the law is the life of the dark world.
Jesus came to liberate himself from this law.
Again, I've never tried to quit drinking.
At one point, the desire to drink wine was completely gone.
The reason for being free from alcoholism is that through worship, word, and prayer, the power of the Lord Jesus, the Creator, flowed to Him through the filling of the Holy Spirit.
"For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God" (Galatians 2:19). The law is the minimum ordinance God has given to show who he is.
In particular, Mathematics subjects are given as narrative questions without final exams, and other Korean, English, science, and history subjects are selected as selective questions.
According to the "2019 Curriculum Policy Implementation Plan" announced by the Gyeonggi-do Office of Education last January, middle school evaluation will be focused on the growth-oriented evaluation.
In Yihyeon Middle School, evaluation is done with the rate of 40% with written exam consisting of selective questions and 60% of the performance evaluation, only midterm exam for Korean language, and final exam for history.
In most middle schools, the ratio of performance evaluations and essay-style exam combined is more than 50%, but in Suji Middle School, it is relatively low in mathematics for 47.2% and Korean for 46%.
Among them, English and science will be evaluated only with multiple-choice questions, Korean will be evaluated twice with written tests, consisting of 27% of multiple-choice questions and 3% of essay-style exam, and math will be done so with 26.4% of multiple-choice questions and 3.6% of essay-style tests.
Except for the history course, which carries out final exams at the ratio of 31.2% for multiple-choice question tests and 8.8% for essay tests, subjects like Korean, English, math, and science will be evaluated by written test on the midterm and final exams.
The percentage of other subjects' assessments like English, math, and science and essay-type assessments is 55% for English and math respectively, and 53.2% for science.
It is notable that in Sunae Middle School, the Korean language course is rated 40% by a single final exam, which is the same as the history.
Among them, we checked the number of written tests and the percentage of performance evaluations in major subjects (Korean, English, math, history, science) that parents of middle school students who finished the free school year are most curious about.
Among them, history subjects showing the highest ratio of 60%, are rated 40% by final exams with multiple-choice questions and 60% for performance evaluations.
At this time, the narrative questions are not asked, but an evaluation is made only by an optional question.
"Given the investigation records sent by the police, the prosecution should have carried out a strict investigation into vice-minister Kim's possible sexual favors and donations of money and valuables," the past affairs committee noted.
"Considering this, we were able to fully understand the circumstances in which Yoon used a large number of women to provide sexual favors to former Vice Minister Kim and make a request for the case under the pretext of this," the past affairs committee said.
In this regard, the police said that they had applied for a forbiddance of leaving the country and arrest warrant of the former vice-minister Kim, but both of them were rejected by the prosecution and had difficulty investigating the case.
Focused on investigating charges handed by the police at that time.
In the diary there was also a mention of former Vice Minister Kim.
It is pointed out that there is a greater need for investigation into the prosecutor's command line and investigation team, as the purpose of the investigation by the prosecution team investigating the case of the former vice minister Kim was at "external pressure of investigation".
The past affairs committee released the results of an investigation to the effect that the prosecution actively utilized the police's sending of the case by applying only sex crime charges.
"The police's distortion of the investigation resulted in a situation in which the prosecution's primary investigation team could easily overlook Kim Hak-eu and Yoon Jung-cheon," the past affairs committee judged.
The police, even though they secured the evidence of bribery charges, sent only the sexual crime to Prosecution Service, and Prosecution Service was only being around the investigation of police, not "re-investigating from the start", even though it is a matter where nationwide suspicion is large, due to not winning the Vice Minister of Ministry of Justice position.
Subsequently, the KFDA, which received a final report that the two-component ingredient was finally confirmed as renal cells, asked Kolon Life Science to stop manufacturing and selling Invossa on March 31.
It was 4 months after Kolon TissueGene, Inc. found out the results of the inspection and, coincidentally, the day after the approval of Invossa-K Inc. was issued.
A fierce controversy appeared after the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety had found out that the goods sold actually contained kidney cells and that before receiving the approval the developer of Invossa-K Inj., Kolon Tissuegene recognized the two-step component could be kidney cells.
The MFDS decided that Kolon Life Science, which received the right to develop and sell Invossa-K Inc. in Korea from Kolon Tissuegene, must have known this and revoked the approval on the 28th, considering the results of its domestic research institute and on-site inspections in the U.S.
During the three-phase clinical trial to receive the approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Kolon Life Science found out in their own genetic tests that the two-step component could change into kidney cells and then gave a report of the possibility to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.
Kolon Life Sciences is likely to file an administrative suit against the KFDA.
Trial was held at the 417th grand courtroom, where the trials of Park Geun-hye and former President Lee Myung-bak were held.
On the same day, the lawyer of the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Yang challenged the prosecution's remarks, saying, “Some of the contents exceed the limits set by the Criminal Procedure Act.“
Attention is drawn to how the court will control the litigation on whether the former judicial leaders, who claim that the investigation itself is wrong, violate the independence of the court.
The two former justices of the Supreme Court arrived in court 20 minutes before the trial began and shook hands with a hard look.
The former Supreme Court chief Yang, who was arrested, entered a courtroom after the trial began, wearing a white label with a number on his suit.
In addition to the curriculum, the special lecture will allow students to develop IoT-based smartphone apps through coding training.
The students who passed the essay test with fierce competition have increased from the previous year.
The dormitory program, Myungjeong Talent, which focuses on the convergence on self-directed learning, personality, deep learning, and arts education, is popular among students because of its consistent achievements in school record.
In 1st year of high school, one-man, one-instrument lessons are required twice a week for personality and art education, and the orchestra will be held at the end of the year.
Although the 2019 College Scholastic Ability Test was particularly difficult, students of liberal arts who have good writing skills and achieved required CSAT scores, and those of natural sciences with excellent math skills performed well in the essay test.
The new bill is similar to the previous one, only adding that it prevents medical personnel from refusing to have an abortion operation for conscientious reasons.
Argentina, where about 77 percent of its population is Catholic, allows abortions only when sexual assault or maternal health is at risk under current law.
Charities estimate that 100 pregnant women die as a secret illegally performed 500,000 abortions a year in Argentina.
Victoria Tessoriero, president of the "campaign for the right to legal, safe and free abortion rights," said activists will continue to press on lawmakers during the general election.
The Health Ministry estimates that there are as many as 350,000 cases of unofficial abortions.
In other words, about KRW 3.1 trillion out of the new Hyundai Heavy Industries debt is an advance payment and estimated liabilities.
The claim of the union seems convincing because it is weighed numerically, but the company emphasizes that it is inevitable to deal with the work in accordance with the regulations and also for the merging with the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering.
If the split is passed, the existing HHI will be split into an intermediary holding company, Korea Offshore & Shipbuilding and its wholly owned subsidiary, Hyundai Heavy Industries.
The ostensible reason for the labor union's apparent struggle is that "due to excessive debts that remain at the new Hyundai Heavy Industries, the financial structure becomes insolvent and eventually leads to restructuring."
In accordance with the Holding Companies Act, each company takes over debts that are relevant to the business.
Darwin's honor in the visit of the powerful shows his modest character, but on the other hand it shows Darwin's lack of a "historic eye".
If Darwin had been recognized for his early study talent and walked as the doctor's way, he probably lived a very calm and comfortable life.
I am not saying that politics is not important.
In other words, it may be right that Darwin is honored from the "point of view of the time", but if you look at it in the "long flow of history", it is Gladstone, not Darwin.
100 years and 500 years later, the names of the greatest contemporary figures disappear, and only the names of scientists, artists and writers who did not have a presence in the present day may be remembered.
They say that since much of the cultural and artistic policies are decided in the political arena, historical ideas and insights are even more urgently requested for politicians.
Russell is saying that the evaluation of the time and the evaluation of the future generation are not the same.
"It's especially hard because we don't have any bathing facility at home, and since there's a lot of people on a weekend, I try to go there on a weekday when there are fewer people," Kim said.
Park Gyeom-su, the head of the Gangbuk-gu Office, explains the 'Gangbuk Oasis,' which lowers the ambient temperature by emitting fine water particles for residents who use the shades against the heatwave.
The district will give vouchers for using a jjimjilbang for low-income elderly people, especially those with bad residential conditions, and each business will cut its price by 30%.
Originally, the government designated one place each in Mia-dong, Suyu-2-dong, and Songcheon-dong, but the number increased to five as businesses each in Ui-dong and Suyu-dong came out to provide the elderly without family a place to rest.
"In the beginning, if they use the expired voucher, I could bear losses because it won't pay for it," said Yoo Mi-seon, the head of Samil Sauna in Songcheon-dong, but also said, "I think that's what all people have to do."
"It is difficult to benefit the entire population due to a large number of elderly people with low incomes, but we will try to expand the number of people who can use the system," said Kim Hyeong-seop, the director of the safety measurement division in Gangbuk-gu.
Since the summer of last year, when the excessive heatwave warning was issued for 43 days, the government has signed an agreement with local jjimjilbangs and has been supporting elderly people to allow them to use the facilities free of charge.
They signed a business agreement with once large facilites in each area.
Four areas around traffic islands and crosswalks with large numbers of pedestrians have been chosen as priority targets.
It was operated in the form of giving two vouchers each when an excessive heatwave or coldwave warning is issued and giving them again after the usage, and the response is the best compared to other safety management supplies such as portable fans or cool scarves.
One of the most important things head coach Bento thinks is identity.
At that time, Jung Wooyoung fell sharply in his physical strength in the second half.
"The role of the '1' line is crucial to keep the defensive back in the 4-1-3-2 big league, which takes all-out pressure, advancing three midfielders with offensive talent and activity."
There should be two defensive midfielders to protect the defense of the four-back.
"Competition to take his place is expected to be fierce, and attention is drawn on the tactical choices that Bento will come up with."
If you look at the game, Jo Sejong and Jung Woo-young were mostly active.
As the opponent hikes the line considerably, they struggled with consistent pressure.
As the midfield grip fell, opponents on the other side began to move forward, limiting the movement of the left and right fullbacks.
When asked how to prevent presbyopia and cataracts, he said first to stay away from things that tire eyes such as smartphones and monitors, and that it is important to do eye exercises regularly and receive regular check up.
After some time passes, I do use the magnifying glass again time to time.
Choi said, "Many people think of presbyopia as insignificant, but the sooner the initial action of presbyopia is taken, the better the effect."
Director Choi advised that cataract is similar to presbyopia, so it is confused easily, and that as people often miss the period for surgery, they need to pay more attention.
Ophthalmology was very competitive because of its limited quota.
Presbyopia LASIK is a principle of making one eye focus far away and the other close, making imbalance in a pair of eyes, which takes a considerable amount of time to adapt.
He chose an ophthalmologist in obedience to God.
Two protectors of kendo were facing.
Many cataract patients have been left untreated for a long time.
It is also important to determine whether the disposal of the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety was appropriate during the marketing authorization process.
An investigation will also have to be conducted on former Kolon Group Chairman Lee Woong-yeol, who suddenly retired from the company in November last year after leading the Invossa project as the CEO of Kolon Life Sciences.
In the first screening of Invossa at the Central Pharmacist Review Committee of the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, six out of seven judges opposed for the reason that it does not properly qualify for the new drug.
Through such things as due diligence on the ground, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety confirmed the fact that Kolon Life Sciences submitted a false material that fabricated evidence in the process of an approval for the sale of a new drug.
The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said that there are no problems with the safety of the drug since there have been no significant side effects among patients taking the drug, but patients are worried about the aftereffects and are feeling betrayed.
The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety on the 28th revoked license for Korean products of Invossa K Inj., a gene therapy for osteoarthritis that turned out to be a "fake new drug." and filed criminal complaints against executive directors of Kolon Life Sciences. a manufacturing and sales company of it.
Kolon Life Sciences and its U.S. subsidiary Kolon TissueGene were suspended from trading shares on the same day.
Suspicions of affiliation with Kolon have been raised, and the matter needs investigation.
To find drug combinations that can meet the complexity, you need to combine your understanding of how illness works with the tremendous power of machine learning and the ability to recognize patterns.
Big data and automation were introduced into genomics when his team demonstrated for the first time that ultra-high-speed computers could be used to speed up the processing of DNA samples.
"It's my feeling that 50 pills can cure all diseases." If so, that would change the definition of another word.
Data without instructions alone cannot find meaningful knowledge.
In October last year, one of Pharnext's complex drugs showed positive results in a three-phase clinical trial in humans.
The stock price of Pharnext, which is listed on the Paris stock market in France, has more than doubled since the release of Phase III clinical results in October last year.
Several researchers, including Koen, now believe that obsession with simplicity is associated with a decrease in drug discovery.
As the scientific community has realized recently, the definition of disease has been overly simple.
A long-term objective for the research team is constructing a pool of new drug candidates with machine learning much more efficiently than the large drug companies that are notorious for being slow.
At the beginning of modern genetic studies, very few predicted that the biology of diseases would be so complex.
It accepts the complexity of the body and uses AI to more systematically analyze and map the chain of effects that occur when a disease covers the body.
There is a narrow Gothic building in Midtown Manhattan.
His 2014 book "Linked" has popularized the idea that network theory can explain a number of areas such as fashion trends, sexual relationships and diseases.
Subsequently, other catalogs discovered, such as proteins encoded in DNA and transcripts, which convert DNA to proteins, have further complicated the variables acting on the gene-disease relationship.
Machine learning can recognize patterns on a large scale and infer what might have happened in the past based on them.
To do this, the relationship between computer science and biology must be developed.
Pharnext venture companies believe that the pleiotropism in drugs are possible.
Even while staying at the Mar-a-lago resort in Florida, President Trump reportedly complained about Bolton aide, saying, "He is pushing the way I don't want to go."
There are also observations that Trump is hesitant to replace because of the close relationship between Bolton and chairman of casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson Sands Group.
In a recent private meeting, President Trump sarcastically criticized Bolton's belligerent attitude and said, "If I had assigned the job to John (Bolton aide), the U.S. would have been fighting four wars at the same time," reported the New York Times on the 28th (local time).
There have been a series of speculations that the national security adviser John Bolton's status has been greatly dampened before and after U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit to Japan.
A person close to President Trump said the situation surrounding Bolton is similar to the one just before former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was replaced.
Speculation is rampant over the background, especially as Bolton is reportedly absent from a state dinner hosted by Japanese Emperor Naruhito.
A total of 123 cultural properties, allegedly stolen 25 years ago, were found damaged, including the National Treasure No. 1008, a Nationally Designated Cultural Property treasure, Mangugjeondo.
In October 2017, the police obtained information saying that one artwork auction company in Jongno-gu District would sell handwritten woodblocks of the Prince Yangnyeong, which was stolen from the special exhibition of Buddhist artwork.
A police official said, "While A claims that the nationwide evangelism has been purchased without knowing whether it is a nationally designated cultural property, this is a common crime tactic for cultural asset thieves."
The police judged that B had a good knowledge of cultural heritages enough to know the value of stolen woodblocks, since he/she has been involved in antique trade business for a long time.
In particular, the wooden board of Sungnyemun Gate is of great value as cultural assets, which is the only existing woodblock with the three letters of Sungnyemun embossed.
The latter Part of Red Wall Poem is the written piece by Prince Yangnyeong in a cursive style, based on the poem that the Chinese poet of the Chinese Song Dynasty Dongpo recited about desolated warmth of winter moonlit nights.
According to the police, A is suspected of obtaining the Manguk World Map designated as Treasure No. 1008 and ancient books, and hiding it in a restaurant he runs after he knew they were stolen.
It is the first time in history that a reward and punishment committee will be held for retired athletes.
He qualified for free agency (FA) after the end of last season, but had planned to surrender his right and finish his baseball career at Samsung this year.
Some point out that athletes are still lacking in drunken driving.
His back number 33 is likely to be a permanent absence.
A baseball official stressed, "The baseball community must make efforts to raise awareness that drinking is a shortcut to say goodbye to baseball."
Coach Kim encouraged athletes to do their best, not to be disturbed by the sudden retirement of Park Han-yi in a team meeting ahead of the game.
"He was a former home run and RBI king baseball star from the northern league of the Futures League in 2017, and was a candidate for the first base Slugger, which LG had been looking for so much, but ended up losing everything due to alcohol."
However, due to the strengthened discipline of drunk driving, the three athletes caught this year have a common denominator, "You cannot play baseball."
Plants are emerging as a new family member of young single-person households.
"When you go to the flower market, you can see that the number of young customers has increased." The age group of people who visit plant-related lectures has also decreased.
SNS, Café, and Essay, these three means "youth", unlike the previous generation, who are interested in plants.
It is vivid, beautiful, and pleasant, but I think the existence of a plant that doesn't bother me may have the appearance of an ideal friend that the Millennial generation wants.
In the past, books on plants were illustrated books mostly written by experts, but essays written by authors like lovers rather than experts are increasing the number.
In particular, this year's admissions process is different from last year because of the free school year system, it only reflects three semesters from the second year to the first semester of the third year.
The document evaluation and individual interviews, which were included in the first stage of the last year, will be held in the first and second stages, and about 160 people, twice the recruitment quota, will be selected as interviewees.
Common documents submitted to the admission process of Gyeonggi Buk Science High School include applications for admission, self-introduction, teacher recommendation, school life records No. 2 (for a high school application) where the original scores/standard deviation and the talent data are all deleted from the educational development progress, and consent for the use of personal information.
The admission process of science high schools for this year will begin on August 12, followed by the announcement of successful applicants by stages, followed by a call-up interview on November 16, and the final successful applicants will be announced on November 22.
If they pass the high school at the first term high schools, they should remember that they cannot apply to later high schools such as foreign language high school, international high school, autonomous public and private high schools and general high schools at the second term high schools.
Gyeonggibuk Science High School, the only science school in Gyeonggi-do Province, announced the admission of new students for 2020.
Although FlashWolves has failed to reach the round of 16 for the past few years, much expected from both inside and outside of the team as it reached the semifinals of the "2018 Mid-Season Invitational (MSI)".
"By the time I go to the army, I think I'll be reminded of what to do after retirement." Right now, he wants to focus on the role of a professional gamer."
If the team had been promoted to the first division, he could have stayed on the European stage.
The team's performance didn't go well, and there was a lack of individual chances to play.
He believes that his skills and solo ranks are proportional.
Its strength is that it has a wide field of view and excellent instantaneous judgment.
If you are having difficulty studying at home alone or want to learn coding faster to an advanced level, it is more effective to sign up for a coding academy.
Coding can be a good alternative at a time when students are encouraged to conduct autonomous research and experience activities by strengthening their specialty activities and career exploration activities through the implementation of the free semester and grade system in middle school.
Steve Jobs said that coding teaches you how to think.
"There is a way to create better results by using coding when forming and operating autonomous clubs by spending the free semester (year)," said Park Hak-bin, the president of the NEXTop Coding Institute.
Just as sociality is important to live with people, you need to learn a computer language to communicate with them. And coding is a way to communicate in that language.
Software-focused universities for integrated software-focused talents, which is supported by the national budget, started with eight universities including Korea University in 2015, and five more schools were selected this year, bringing the total number to 35.
In its report, <The Future of the Job Market>, Davos Forum predicted that 7.1 million jobs will be gone by 2020 due to the progress of the fourth industrial revolution, with only 2 million jobs to be created.
There are a variety of online coding education programs or related books for children who want to learn Scratch and Entry alone, so anyone can learn the basics of coding while following them at home.
These days, there are children who are so addicted to games that their academic performance is adversely affected, but it is often an opportunity for them to learn how to code.
In the exhibition hall of the Galleria degli Uffizi, the famous Florence pronoun, the works of Antony Gormley, who made up a figure of iron blocks, and the statue of the Roman female body, are on display side by side.
”Obaekna Hanjeon,” which synaesthetically mingles with sight, hearing, and sense of touch, is a cooperative exhibition created by artist Kim, who put heads together with the museum curator Park Kyung-eun since the beginning of this year.
This is a new film released by Kim Seung-young, who is well-known for installing sound.
In a space as quiet as a room between the towers, 29 minutes of Na Han-sang of Goryeo, 600 to 700 years ago, sat on his seat.

U.S. Navy soldiers attending President Trump's speech in Japan have attached patches with Trump's presidential slogan on their combat uniforms, sparking controversy.
It is not the first time that controversy has erupted over undermining political neutrality amid President Trump's visit to U.S. military bases overseas.
In last December, he visited the U.S. military base in Iraq and signed on hats of soldiers with MAGA logo.
Fox News reported on the 29th that the U.S. government is considering whether the soldiers of the U.S. Forces in Japan who attended President Trump's speech violated the Defense Department's dress code regarding political neutrality.
At the time, some of the Navy personnel who attended President Trump's speech attached a patch with the phrase "Make Aircrew Great Again" (picture) on their arms.
The Pentagon does not allow soldiers to reveal their political preferences.
This is because it is difficult for importers to find substitute suppliers that are cheaper than existing suppliers.
The first thing is a tariff paid by consumers, and the second is a deadweight loss , or net loss of economic utility that occurs when the balance of goods or services is not optimal.
The size of the consumer burden depends on how much foreign exporters reflect tariffs on their export prices, and how much U.S. demand for imports with tariffs is.
According to a paper published by UCLA professor Pablo Fazelbaum in March this year "The Return of Protectionism", the 10% tariffs the U.S. imposed on China last year were completely transferred to import prices.
In this method, the U.S. government provides subsidies to soybeans and dairy farmers who are suffering from the U.S.-China trade
The high-rate tariffs raise consumer prices of Chinese products, making U.S. importers more dependent on alternative countries to import from, other than China.
It's quicker to compare last year's 10% tariff on China's $200 billion exports to the US and a 15% additional tariff earlier this month.
This is because money from consumers or companies has been transferred to the U.S. government coffers.
According to economic theory, dead-weight loss rises higher than tariffs.
Ten days later, a councilor in Embassy of the Republic of Korea in the United States of America leaked the phone conversation between the leaders of South Korea and the U.S. to the lawmaker Kang Hyo-sang.
First of all, it is necessary to appoint a person who can lead the bureaucracy and take over the work so that the president's will is correctly executed in the ministry.
Until the 1990s, when it was considered impossible to change the regime, government officials regarded the president's administrating philosophy as their official philosophy and considered as ”patriotic” by practicing.
The conversations between the two, without knowing that the microphone was on, seemed to be ”frankly” revealing the real opinion of the Blue House and the ruling party on civil servants.
There is a funny story that was told in Washington during the Bush presidency, the former President George W. Bush, who recently attended the 10th anniversary of the former President Roh Moo-hyun, was the talk of the town.
The days are over when civil servants naturally accepted the president's philosophy on state affairs.
Secondly, the president needs to increase his touch with government officials.
While the Moon Jae-in government had pursued a drastic policy change, the bureaucratic society, tied to the policy rank of the past regime, was not ready to support and implement this.
It is for this reason that it is very important for civil servants to move for the success of the president's management of state affairs, not for the benefit of the ministry.
"The president's political opponent is the Democratic Party, but the president's enemy is within the government." The remarks came as officials at the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department, which oppose Bush's foreign policy, leaked so much internal information to the media.
Economic policies, financial policies, and public policies of the Moon Jae-in government have received a failing grade by the international community.
Korea's national competitiveness dropped one notch to 28th this year from last year after the International Graduate School of Management and Development (IMD) in Switzerland evaluated four categories: corporate efficiency, government efficiency, economic performance and infrastructure.
South Korea's national competitiveness has fallen another notch this year.
If you take a look at the content, the corporate regulatory sector fell from 47th to 50th and the government debt sector fell from 23rd to 27th and it played a big part.
It is comforting for the company that, it has improved labor motivation and entrepreneural spirit developing the ability to respond to new challenges and increasing competitiveness of the company's efficiency sector with 9 steps reaching 34th place.
There's still a long way to go, so it's frustrating that the competitiveness is decreasing.
The decision came after the IMD gave a harsh assessment of the massive injection of funds into the government-led job expansion process.
At that time, the prosecution revealed the results of its investigation that the National Intelligence Service illegally wiretapped around 1,800 people, including relatives of the president, high-ranking government officials, politicians and journalists, and actively engaged in domestic politics during the days of the two former chiefs.
Clause 4 of Article 9 of the National Intelligence Service Act prohibits "acts of campaigning for certain parties or specific people, or of engaging in election-related countermeasure meetings," and the Liberty Korea Party claims that Director Seo violated it.
The assembly participants said, “It was a private meeting irrelevant to the politics,” but the fact that the head of the National Intelligence Service and the general election strategy officer of the ruling party faced each other for a long time provided an excuse for the opposition party to attack.
Indeed, measures were taken to prevent political intervention by the National Intelligence Service, such as abolishing intelligence-related departments, but he also faced the attack from the opposition party as his meeting with Director Yang was made known.
During Park Geun-hye administration, Former Directors Nam Jae-joon, Lee Byeong-gi and Lee Byeong-ho were indicted due to such things as charges of paying special activity costs for the National Intelligence Service to Cheong Wa Dae, and were sentenced to imprisonment until the sentence at an appeals trial in December last year.
In the case of indiscriminate stabbing in a residential area near Novorito Park in Kawasaki, Japan, malicious false rumors that Zainichi (Koreans living in Japan or Joseon nationality) was responsible are spreading around Japan's right wing.
Japan's progressive online media "Litera" reported on the 28th that groundless rumors have been rampant that the culprit is Zainichi after the killing of an elementary school student in Kawasaki.
Riterra criticized that all of these claims were unfounded.
The media said, "There is an unfounded claim to brand the Koreans in Japan as a criminal centering around the right-wing, not knowing who the criminal is, as well as the motives and damage details."
Even false information such as "the Koreans in Japan derailed the train after earthquake confusion" or "the Koreans in Japan are trying to plunder important cultural assets" spread around social network services (SNS).
Malicious rumors targeting Zainichi spread on the Internet after the March 2011 earthquake and the April 2016 Kumamoto earthquake.
According to Litera, right-wingers also claimed that "Zainichi is a criminal" in July 2016 in a mass murder case at Saga Prefecture's disabled facilities.
"It is clearly a discriminatory instigation and a Hite-speech to attach malicious labels to any crime by combining characteristics of nationality, ethnicity or origin," he/she added.
In Japan, there is no way to punish or control a malicious rumor that targets Koreans in the form of "criminal Zainichi" whenever a violent crime occurs.
Parental allowances will be provided from the month including the date a guardian applies for parental allowance until February of the following year when the infant becomes six years old.
A reward of KRW 3 million will be given for those who report feeding out-of-date food, and KRW 1 million for reporting reusing cooked food or cooking raw materials or finished products that have expired.
If a petitioner is unhappy with the outcome of a request handled by the head of an administrative agency, he or she can file a complaint to the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission or the Civil Complaints Commission.
The reward payment for reporting misconduct at daycare centers has been raised.
In addition to the Office of Civil Affairs, the government has decided to expand the counter for receiving complaints from the department in charge of the reception and dispatch of documents prescribed by the head of the administrative agency, or the department in charge of handling the complaint.
Beginning in the second half, the establishment of a national public nursery is mandatory for building more than 500 households.
I did not have any significant reason, but I left because my friend, who was on an escape abroad at that time, said that I could stay there at a low price.
In that place, I came to realize how much I loved my mother language, that is, how much I liked to make other people laugh by my native language.
From manager Kim or something the manager Kim has been dragging on, strangely grievous gooey cigarette-like odor started stinking.
Team manager Kim or foreman Kim was buzzing around, calling the names of the team manager and deputy manager, asking Min-chul that why he had bought tasteless coffee, asking Jae-pil that what he should do.
He started to irritate me by saying that even if I answered firmly, I sometimes needed to walk and rest to lose weight (then what are you going to explain your stomach?).
Leader Kim could not search for the lowest price on a shopping site well, which my aunt and dad, looking at their 70s, had no problem with.
I went back to my seat, feeling the urge to clobber A, who said, "Just think that you are cleaning dung for fifteen days."
No one answered right, which means, now I have to be his conversation buddy.
Suddenly, I wondered what kind of thought I'd do before falling asleep when I am about his age.
He said, crumpling the cigarette into the paper cup he was holding.
Oh said, leading Kim to an empty seat next to me.
Suddenly he asked my hometown and where I lived and said that my neighborhood was where he went to high school.
He said he created such an ambiguous position because it is a job that I used to be in charge of, such as purchase business, and repairs or general chores for the company's building.
Given that Trinity Club's parent company is Shinsegae, the motto of the golf course is to treat its members as top customers.
In contrast to the seemingly solid appearance, the inside is composed with the combination of sensuous interiors and art works, and high quality furniture to create a relaxing and calm atmosphere.
There are many golf courses in Japan that are dressed with the word “masterpiece”.
He captured idyllic landscapes of hilly mountains which blend in with the surroundings and feature distinctive four seasons in 18 holes of 7,373 yards.
Old pine trees, hack berries, cherry trees, and giant oak trees greet golfers like gardens.
In my area, the autonomous private high school which is favored by middle school students is seen, Baejae high school, and Handaebu high school.
Now, if you think that many first grade students in independent private highschool get questions in the english test wrong, they are not.
You need to be able to digest a lot of coverage in preparation for the exam.
English private institutes prepare for junior high school exams for about four weeks, which is less than 10% compared to that of the English proficiency of the English exams of Paichai High School and Hanyang University High School.
Today, I am going to write about how middle school students should study in preparation for school grades on English to go to autonomous private high schools, which a lot of students in our area go to.
In case of math, people think that students should study in advance, but they often don't know the degree of "in advance" of English.
In case of Boin High School, about 50 students from Songpa Middle School go to the school, and then a lot of students from Oryun Middle School, Boseong Middle School, Jamsil Middle School, and Jamsin Middle School apply for it.
The scope of the examination includes 2~3 chapters of the textbook, and two or three mock tests, TED or additional materials, but few students memorize all these texts due to its vast range.
It's unfortunate so that my wife and I have been nice to the bear.
That's why Ppobbi didn't want to move.
If I could communicate with dogs, I would have told Eun-gom why it had to have the surgery and the inconvenience it would have experienced after the operation.
It is because of why Eun-gom had to play with the ball despite the pain caused by dislocation.
Even after coming to my house, the temper continued. She even ran over older sisters and brothers who’s bigger than her for eating problems.
Actually, my wife and I felt like the entire house was empty when Eungom was disappeared, and we are waiting nervously for the day of Eungom coming back.
It breaks my heart to think about how hard and painful the walk must have been.
More and more lawmakers not only go to major countries such as the U.S., China, Russia, and Japan, but also have chosen topics for each standing committee and traveled on long-term business trips.
In addition, Moon Hui-sang, the Chairman of the National Assembly, is urging lawmakers to travel abroad while emphasizing their diplomacy, they actually see the "limping period" as a "time to travel" as they ara not expected to have time to go abroad if the National Assembly is held.
Even if the party changes its nomination rules to renovate itself, it tends to make an election primary rather than 'downward' strategic nominations as it did in the past, which is expected to be more likely to survive when he or she secures regional votes.
Despite the public's growing criticism that it is a "waste of money" as it continues its "dereliction of duty" this year, the assembly hall seems relaxed and lawmakers are using this "good times" to manage their constituencies and travel abroad.
Then, they put up a normalization condition of the National Assembly that the Democratic Party would be hard to accept.
In the case of current members, it has been the core strategy to focus on the securement of right members until the end of July and then imprint a public image through the parliamentary inspection of the administration and the 2020 budget.
The statistics production process of the National Statistical Office is so organized that it is arguably 100% impossible for anyone to intentionally disrupt it at any moment.
Although I do not have many opportunities to meet the president in person, I know that (the president) grasps that trend accurately regarding the statistics.
Among households whose members are two or more, households whose householders are over 60 years old account for more than 60%, and the proportion continues to increase.
Next month, the National Statistical Office will officially set and announce when the peak of the economy was.
The top or low of the game is set after a few years by the Statistics Office.
The consumer composite sentiment index is one of the indicators of how consumers feel and perceive the economy.
It can be interpreted that export is getting sluggish, and the decline of various economic indicators and the sluggish stock market have affected consumers' judgment.
This is due to the widespread prospect that housing prices will recover around Seoul, with actual transaction prices at major apartment complexes in the Gangnam area rising.
According to the May 2019 Results on Consumer Survey, reported on the 28th by the Bank of Korea, the composite consumer sentiment index(CCSI) of this month was 97.9, which is a decrease of 3.7p from April.
There is also concern that prices will rise.
"Since there are only a limited number of experts in restructuring, it will have to offer a considerable salary to recruit talented professionals," said an expert in corporate restructuring.
It is expected to take some time as there are not many professionals with experience in corporate restructuring, and they are mainly contacting accountants belonging to large accounting firms.
On the market, Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co. is expected to seek to M & A by the end of the year, but will not be in a hurry to dispose of it.
KDB selected Hoban Construction as the bidder of priority for the sale last year and sought to sell Daewoo Engineering & Construction, but the sale was canceled due to massive losses at Daewoo Engineering & Construction's overseas construction site.
Financial authorities did not oppose the KDB's decision, but they are determined to keep a close eye on the case of Daewoo Engineering & Construction, which will be put to the test for the first time, as there are concerns that KDB Investment could become an "another roof on the rooftop in restructuring".
Last November's A-match and the 2019 United Arab Emirates Asian Cup group stage were the only two not played by Son Heung-min after manager Bento took the helm of the national team.
"Coach Bento's greed, saying "I want to select the best player from the point of view of the national team coach" and Son Heung-min's willingness to play in the game seems to be reflected in this convention."
Madrid, Spain, is the venue for the final match between Tottenham and England Liverpool.
As it is the most important competition of the season, concentration and fatigue are huge.
Son Heung-min, who has a good sense of foot recently, is certain to play in the next match.
Australia and Iran will face each other next month, and they will be in the best position as they are an important stage to evaluate the power ahead of the 2022 Qatar World Cup qualifiers.
Paulo Bento, South Korean national football team coach called in Son Heung-min once again.
It is based on the judgment that the part-time job measures are not much different from the conservative administration of the past decade, with an increasing possibility of being stuck under a sexist system.
Because of this situation, a skeptical view of whether the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, which has to be leading the gender equality policies, is gaining power does not go away.
The report released by the International Labor Organization (ILO) in March said that Korea's gender wage gap is 34.5%, the highest among the countries surveyed.
The president's remarks and behaviors have indeed raised expectations for women's policies that have gone one step further than the past government.
The last two years of the Moon Jae-in government have seen an explosive increase in gender issues.
Although a new system for reducing city gas prices has been established recently, there are still some problems to solve, such as its uncertainty of when it gives enough bang for the investments, given the extent of technological innovation and reduction in supply unit prices.
The Seoul Metropolitan Government said on the 28th that it will work on drawing up the design standards so that next-generation hydrogen fuel cells can be introduced in new private medium and large buildings.
It is also pointed out that there are still many challenges to overcome in order for hydrogen fuel to become more common.
The operating temperature is lower than 100 degrees Celsius, making it easy to turn it on and off, so it is suitable for homes or small buildings that use power only when it is needed.
Once the design criteria are established and announced, they are immediately applied to the new building.
With the ease of installation of solid oxide fuel cells, new buildings in Seoul expand the selection.
The establishment of design standards promoted by Seoul is the basis for introducing SOFC.
He went to club NB in Gangnam-gu, Seoul where he was a DJ every Saturday, and he said he was naturally accompanied by his friends wanting to go to the club.
(Chairman Yang) said that he knows 'Madam Jeong' well, Reporter Koh said. "The singer from YG who attended the meeting also said, "I know Madam Jeong well, but I don't know why women were mobilized."
At first, I sent a Kakao Talk message to a YG's press promotion manager and told him that I wanted to interview CEO Yang, Reporter Koh said. "But he read the message and didn't reply."
Appearing on MBC's radio show "Shim In-bo's Eyes-Catching" on the 28th, Reporter Koh said he had tried to contact CEO Yang several times to hear Yang's position on the alleged sexual service.
According to Reporter Koh, Yang admitted that he shared meals with a group of Southeast Asian financiers, but denied allegations of sexual favors.
Former minister Yoon diagnosed that the ruling camp should reach out first.
Former minister Yoon was concerned about the possibility of a longer parliamentary vacuum.
In politics, there is a way to win by losing, and a way to live by dying.
Just as there was a democratic versus anti-democratic structure in the past.
Although the Liberty Korea Party has ended its outdoor protest, negotiations on normalizing the National Assembly have made no progress.
It is a diagnosis that the political calculation aimed at the general election may be concealed.
As if to show such a change in the situation, Prime Minister Abe's remarks were outspoken.
In terms of US-Japan, in May 2016, President Obama visited Hiroshima, and in December of that year, Prime Minister Abe visited Pearl Harbor and let out all the bad feelings from the history.
Additionally, the two leaders walked together along the deck of Gaga, the largest vessel of the Maritime Self-Defense Force(length of 248m), shook hands with the Self-Defense Force staff, and took a commemorative photograph.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe quickly approached and asked for a handshake.
The U.S. president's declaration of Japan's new aircraft carrier as a major ally of the U.S. military on the Self-Defense Forces ship is a major reversal.
Kang Seok-yeon's Food and Drug Administration Bio"The data submitted by Kolon Life Sciences when it was approved for the osteoarthritis drug 'Invossa-K' was found to be false," the director general of the drug said in a briefing at the Food and Drug Administration in Osong, North Chungcheong Province, on Friday. "We will file a criminal complaint against Kolon Life Sciences."
Although the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said that they are filing a criminal complaint against Kolon Life Sciences for selling the drug that has changed ingredients, a voice of criticism is also growing against the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety which approved the sale of the drug.
'Human Cell Management' will be established to provide safety and quality control standards in stages from cell collection, processing, storage, and supply.
Kang said, however, that since the ingredients have changed, there are additional things to be considered, and that long-term follow-up will be conducted on patients with human resources injection.
Even though the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety acknowledged, "Verification and review of the drug were insufficient," but it announced that there would be no such disciplinary action by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety as a reprimand for the person in charge.
If there is a possibility of cell incorporation, it is obligatorily required to submit the results of genetic system tests on the cells used in research and development and manufacturing, and if it is deemed to be an important verification factor, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety will directly test and verify them.
Director Kang said, "It is regrettable that the verification or review of the development stage (of the Invossa) is not enough," but refused to accept the request by the Food and Drug Administration to disclose data submitted by Kolon at the time of approval, saying, "It is possible that the developer has a copyright and can be used by other researchers."
It is also unusual for Prime Minister Merkel and President Macron, who have been standing against the anti-European integration movement or the domination of fascism/nationalism together, to show enmity.
Some point out that the Germany-France conflict is another risk factor in the face of the deepening right-wing situation in the European Parliament, with populism and far-right groups topping the list in France and Italy.
President Macron and Prime Minister Sanchez's idea is to gather forces that have been marginalized in Brussels' "power," including the group to which their parties belong and the Green Party.
The creation of leadership in the European Union is also in jeopardy as a result of elections in which center-right and center-left groups failed to secure a majority for the first time in the 40-year history of the European Parliament.
In particular, French President Emmanuel Macron is leading the move, so the confrontation between France and Germany over the leadership of the European Commission is rising to the surface.
Jean-Claude Junker County Executive Chairman, from Luxembourg Prime Minister, was also released by the European People's Party.
Currently, President Macron has also said that Michel Barnier, French negotiation representative of the European Union's Brexit, has an "incredible qualification," expressing his will to support him.
If ARM, which provides semiconductor design, and Google, Intel, Qualcomm and others join in, and even operating system, Wi-Fi, and small storage (SD) cannot be used, Huawei can only remain a shell only.
In domestic politics these days, American politicians, who have a similar struggle with Korea, say the same voice on a bipartisan basis.
There is a perception that a country that does not keep moral principles to lead universal civilization cannot lead the world.
The difference between THAAD and this issue is that while THAAD is a bilateral issue, Huawei's is riding the trend of international cooperation.
Many experts in the market anticipated a compromise because the United States was forced to bleed if trade wars continued, and the United States would not be able to push ahead next year's presidential election.
The reason why American allies are joining together is the result of strategic choices of what is more in line with national interests.
In the process of dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue, we would like to avoid China's retaliation, as the Korean peninsula is likely to fluctuate and the economy is falling.
This has developed into suspicion that Chinese companies such as Huawei have installed backdoors on their devices to extract information from other nations and companies.
Unlisted companies do not have to inform the market of the company's situation.
If there are companies that stand out amid the rise and fall of numerous companies, the Chinese government will expand support for them.
This, too, seems impossible without the background of the Chinese government.
At the heart of the controversy is Huawei's full support from the Chinese government, including industrial subsidies, serving as an advance guard for China's dominance of global IT hegemony.
The facility will be undertaken by Hwawei and ZTE, telecommunication equipment companies.
It is a small and medium-sized business market with unlimited competition and a monopoly formed.
Except for the Chinese media controlled by the government, U.S. media including Bloomberg News is in the first place, while European media including Britain is in the second.
The strike, which was scheduled for the 30th, has been postponed since the 15 bus and labor unions which took over the semipublic system in Gyeonggi Province withdrew the 3rd adjustment meeting scheduled for the 28th.
According to the Gyeonggi Provincial Labor and Welfare Commission on the 28th, the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, the Gyeonggi Regional Auto Trade Unions and the Gyeonggi Provincial Bus Transport Business Union have withdrawn the third round of wage negotiation negotiations following the introduction of 52 hours a week.
A labor union official said that unless the wage is set at the level similar to the wage level of the transportation workers in Seoul, it will not be easy to discuss and if the agreement is not reached, they could not help but go on a strike on July 1st.
20 or more businesses with a total of 6,447 buses, which have not yet introduced semipublic system to Gyeonggi Province, account for 61 percent of the total 15,584 buses in the city.
If the 52-hour workweek system is introduced for workplaces with more than 300 employees within the province starting in July, it will inevitably change to a two-shift work system on a one-day basis as the number of working hours currently available for up to 68 hours a week will decrease.
About 10 organizations, including the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, pointed out that the government's announced subordinate statutes lack a reissue and the lack of consideration for the real situation taking place at the labor scene, which is not enough to revive the purpose of the law revision.
"Guui Station third anniversary debate" held in the morning of the 27th at the Jeontaeil Memorial Hall in Jongno-gu, Seoul, the story of the remaining tasks also came and went.

Although they are often used in labor fields, they are not managed properly and pay only about the cost of transportation because they have to maintain their status as students.
Juice, milk, kimbap, and snacks were then put on a row.
He pointed out that the government and local governments should create a virtuous circle that directly links students of special-purpose high schools to businesses and pays incentives to companies that thoroughly implement supervision.
According to him, the specialized school students received about 1.5 million won as they were put into practical training, but they receive about 200,000 won as the system was recently changed due to a study-type practice.
On May 28, 2016, Kim (19 years old at the time), who was employed in a silver PSD before his graduation from a special characterization school, died with oil gloves, cup noodles, and triangular kimbap as a article left by the deceased.
A citizen, who might have felt sorry for the fact that he had left a cup noodle he didn't finish in his bag, put the sandwich down in front of the platform.
Inside the National Tax Service, he was welcoming for the appointment of an internal chief, but tensions over his strong work style were reported.
In particular, as President Kim Seung-jun, from the head of the Seoul National Tax Service, has moved from the head of the Seoul National Tax Service to the head of the next National Tax Service candidate, Lee Seung-hee's current chief executive will be focused.
It is interpreted tha because nominee Kim is a trustworthy and such reformed figure although some outsiders are mentioned, it turned to ones from within.
For the next Seoul Commissioner, who can stand still the "Royal Lord," director Kim Dae-ji, who had been verified by the Blue House this time, and the director of Gwangjoo, Kim Hyeon-hwan, are mentioned.
Director Kim Myeong-Joon and Director General Kang Min-soo will be promoted.
Lee Eun-hang, deputy commissioner of the National Tax Service (NTS), who is on the 35th civil service exam, is expected to resign.
Since the head of the National Tax Service has to go through a hearing process, some observers may take time to take office, given the current situation of the National Assembly.
There are few who do not laugh and teach and wait for the people who show their inadequacies.
Oh, and there's one more thing I've realized lately.
I thought it was life to imitate what they saw and hear respectively, to stand their own way, and to fade to little by little.
As time went by, I realized I was mistaken.
That was the meaning of hiding behind their words.
People were not asking me if I had a life teacher.
Korea is no longer a country lacking in material resources.
At first, I thought I was asked if I have a teacher of life.
In the first quarter of this year, China maintained its economy with tax reduction and financial support, which began last year when the trade dispute with the United States surfaced.
It is because of the government's strong stimulus that China's economic growth will not slow down even if trade disputes intensify and tariffs rise.
Providing a large supply of domestic currency and lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy will inevitably expose the country's currency, whether intended or not, to downward pressure.
In the process of stabilizing economic indicators, the exchange rate is likely to be exposed to considerable volatility and the movement of the exchange rate could cause a great sense of crisis in the Korean financial market.
This is especially important for financial market investors.
Among other things, Huawei is a major part of Korea's leading IT companies.
These days, employees at Samsung Electronics are all on edge.
To make matters worse, Apple's sales in China could go down.
The impact on the domestic parts industry has to be great.
The import size of domestic parts is at least 25 times the export.
The 6th Article of this agreement also includes the phrase that the two Koreas ”stop the confrontation and competition on the international stage, cooperate with each other, and work together for the dignity and interests of the people.”
It is a distinct example that the chairman of the state affairs commission Kim thanked president Moon at the Pyongyang summit last year, saying, “The historic North Korea-US reunion is thanks to Moon.”
They have expressed dissatisfaction with the South as the denuclearization negotiation got stopped, but North Korea has not always shown this kind of attitude.
It can only get seen that North Korea is admitting itself that the inter-Korean relationship is hard to get worked out when the North Korea-US relationship is blocked.
If President Donald Trump is won over to these mainstream thoughts of the US, there is a high possibility that the denuclearization problem will remain as it is now without any promise and without finding any solutions.
It is available to talk what you memorize one way at the Bible recitation contest, but as for the open discussion, it is a place where many people gather together to discuss their thoughts on a matter, although reading to what they have learned one-sidely.
Our country is a multi-religious society, and freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution.
Shincheonji must have been afraid to use the Bible in public debates because they only arbitrarily interprets and uses Bible passages to deify Lee Man-hee.
He probably judged that responding to a public debate would do more harm than good at a time when internal confusion due to "the instability of the later structure" and "the continuing excuse of the doctrine" is expected.
The ostensible reason for Shincheonji's refusal to hold a public debate is that their argument, "Let's not look at the Bible in debate", was not accepted.
When the going gets tough, I walk around my place by myself.
He played his first season as a key jungler, and the team, as everyone knows, failed to go on the play offs as sixth place.
He confessed, saying It was hard when I was in the middle of the season, but after it was all over, I thought, I wish I had done a little harder."
The higher the solo rank tier, the more interesting the game became.
Physical fitness and mental management did not work out as expected.
The Uds and Uds are the weaknesses of the team that Hanwha Life athletes have in common.
Before putting on the black uniform, he evaluated Hanwha Life as a pleasant and good team, a potential team, and a bottom duo.
The unveiled still shows "Rabbit Couple" Park Min-young and Kim Jae-wook, who automatically promote the smiles of those who see only two of them.
The bright smiles of the two even make people who watch them feel good.
The friendly atmosphere of the filming site can be seen from the smiles of those who are bright.
In the meantime, "Her Private Life" side is attracting attention by unveiling behind-the-scenes still photos taken at the studio, showing of their strong chemistry.
First, Kim Jae-wook and Jung Si-yul's two shots make viewers smile.
The fact that the Liberty Korea Party, which wrapped up its outdoor protest, is standing at a crossroads where it has to shift to a new phase also raises expectations for the normalization of the National Assembly.
Na Gyeong-won, the floor leader of Liberty Korea Party, has shown her undecided view on the request to hold the security committee, recalling that the issue of holding the committee and normalizing the National Assembly is linked.
Insiders are reportedly discussing various measures, such as a "grand public apology" acceptable to Liberty Korea Party or a "promise to settle an agreement between the ruling and opposition parties on fast track-designated bills".
"Liberty Korea Party appears to be quite willing to return to the National Assembly, but it seems that Democratic Party of Korea is not in a hurry," floor leader Oh said.
Four political parties, excluding the Liberty Korea Party, criticized the leak of the call between the leaders of South Korea and the U.S. to Rep. Kang Hyo-sang, calling it a "deteriorating national interest."
For monitoring of production, operation rate, facility space conservation, and production environment etc., data collection through various sensors corresponding to them should be carried out.
In reality, it is difficult for manufacturing managers and administrators to review every these various smart factory technology, which is why it is necessary to cooperate with competent consultants or professional companies with various experiences.
How many more nodes transmit data accurately by minimizing battery use, is a competing technology for industrial wireless networks.
The combination of Bluetooth used for communications between personal mobile devices and ZigBee which used to form home networks is advancing under the name "Long-range low-power wireless mesh thread."
"Smart Factory is an industrial technology integration that requires mechanical-electrical-electronic-communications-computer technologies, and a comprehensive art that combines data flow, insight and expression techniques."
It is characterized by a desire to transform the border region where the image of anxiety and fear was located in the past because of its proximity to North Korea to a region that leads reconciliation and cooperation between the two Koreas.
You can experience making peace handkerchief by stamping a peace message stamped on Sochang, a special product of Ganghwa.
The Signature of Peace Island and the Great Geumgangsan Peace Music Festival, that will be held at Ganghwa Peace Observatory in Incheon on Saturday, June 1, will also be available at 6 p.m. on June 3 at the MBC Live Tonight.
Park Nam-chun, the Mayor of Incheon, said, “I hope that many tourists from home and abroad will visit Incheon to reflect on the value of peace and feel the charm of Incheon to the full with the announcement of the Peace Island and the nostalgic Kumgang Mountain Peace Music Festival.”
After the ceremony to declare the island of peace, the long-cherished Mount Geumgang Peace Music Festival will follow.
In the case of Unjeong 2 Store which have been in operation for 15 years this year, the headquarters requires the relocation of the store and interior construction under the terms of the contract renewal.
A "guideline" has been created to prevent unfair rejection of contract renewals for long-term merchants who have been operating for more than 10 years due to efforts by the Fair Trade Commission and the Democratic Party.
In principle, the guideline allowed long-term store operators to be renewed if they did not fall into the grounds of refusal of legal renewal, such as violation of the law or violation of business policy.
"With the enactment of the guidelines, long-term store operators' standards and procedures for renewing contracts will become transparent, which will reduce the possibility of conflict," said Lee Soon-mi, head of the trade department at the Fair Trade Commission.
The current affiliate business law authorizes franchisees to request contract renewal for 10 years, but after 10 years, the contract can be terminated without any special reason, causing a dispute.
In BBQ this year, additional to having 3 refusal cases of contract renewal for long-term stores, including the Dohwa branch in Mapo, Seoul, the Unjung 2nd branch in Paju additionally received a notice of non-renewal of the contract recently.
Following the sale of Chairman of LG, Koo Kwang-mo's stake in a subsidiary to pay inheritance tax on his stake in the late Koo Bon-moo, chairman of LG Group, the "inheritance tax risk" seems to spread across the business world.
Yang Ji-hwan, a researcher at Daishin Securities, said, “If there is not a lot of inherited assets except for stakes, the sale of shares is considered to be excessive.”
Koo Kwang-mo inherited 8.8 percent of the late Koo Bon-moo's 11.3 percent stake in LG and was imposed about 720 billion won in inheritance tax.
The share ratio of shares in Doosan Corporation's ordinary shares of the owners' families and other related parties will be changed from 51.08 percent before the sale to 47.24 percent after the stake is sold.
The group's overall management rights are still stable, but Park Jung-won and Park Ji-won, chairmen of the 4th generation management's front-runner status, could see their equity ratios decrease even if they inherit their father's shares.
When we focus on God's work, not on man's work, I believe that our Lord and Father will pour out praise, comfort, encouragement, and love to me and to you.
We should thank God for calling us for not human's work but for God's work, and live for the death and resurrection of Jesus.
How much Peter was treated and shrugged as he followed Jesus, he could not accept it as something it could be happened that Jesus would die.
Even when you follow Jesus, there seems to be nothing in reality, but focus on Jesus even when you do not have what you expect.
I can't stand the rise of someone else than me.
With Park Han-Yi's drunken drive, a player is spotlighted.
A single drunk drive was a tremendous result.
"Since Kang Jeong-ho has entered the United States through a posting system (not FA), he should return to Kiwi Heroes, an affiliate club."
A simple first-time detection will result in a 50-game suspension and a contact accident in a 90-game suspension.
When Kang Jung-ho returns to the KBO League next year, he will be 33 years old.
Whether it is a fiscal policy or a monetary policy, we have been looking all over for its answer, ignoring the fact that the problem places its importance not on how much but on how to.
Currency circulation speed is literally the speed at which money moves around.
There is a record that Germany, which had become an advanced country earlier, grew by 5.7 percent in 1990, the United States by 4.1 percent in 2000, and Sweden by 6 percent in 2010.
There were many people who vaguely expected that growth would rebound only when the growth rate, which was 6.5% in 2010, fell to 3.7% in 2011.
This is not surprising because the rate of change in the currency flow rate is closely related to the growth rate, but it is difficult to say that the recession is difficult.
Currency flow rates tend to decrease as the economy matures, but decreases more as people become more inclined to hold money whether cash or deposits.
When 1 million won worth of transactions take place in a certain period of time and are carried out with 200,000 won worth of current money, the same current money are used five times.
In short, the GDP growth rate seems to be in a jumble of graphs from 1953 to 2010, when the statistics were officially compiled.
According to the Committee, a survey of the workers of thermal power plants confirmed that power company seems to have completed and distributed beforehand the model answer sheet in the form of explanatory material.
In the interview and inspection, a situation was identified in which a partner prepared for the interview by sharing the information of previous interviews in advance in a report form.
In the case of the site investigation, it was suspected that a cooperator tried to disturb the actual inspection about the working environment in advance by cleaning the fallen coal(coal that fell out of the conveyor) and cleaning the site with a fire hose.
"It appears to be a situation in which answers were written as a group based on model answer sheets as particular departments or teams," the special committee said.
In December last year, the power plant systematically interfered with the truth ascertainment of the accident of Kim Yong-gyun, who died during the facility inspection at Taean Thermal Power Plant in Chungnam Province.
Last year, the Ministry of Education and the Korea Educational Development Institute released "2018 Educational Basic statistics," showing the basic education statistics for schools, students, and teachers of primary, elementary, secondary and higher education institutions nationwide, and it shows the total number of students dropped by 2.5%.
First of all, there is no direction and drive on how to manage and lead the students with poor basic education, maladjusted students and students with family crisis in the teacher training process.
All related policies and duties are the affairs of the superintendent of education of cities and provinces.
The question is how Metropolitan and Provincial Offices of Education will accept and enforce these policies.
Yoo Eun-hye, deputy prime minister for social affairs, made eye contact with children who have difficulties in school.
Ahead Day of the Sea, I hope all Koreans realize the importance of the sea and ask them to join us in making it clean.
The sea, which has developed the civilization of mankind as a womb of lives and treasure trove of resources and recently becomes a place of amusement as the quality of our lives has improved, is getting sick because of human indifference.
Day of the Sea was established to better understand the importance of the sea and related industries and promote people's thoughts on the ocean in 1996 commemorating the day when Jang Bo-go, the king of the sea, set up Cheonghaejin.
The vast ocean is inaccessible to us and remains mostly a virgin field.
He descended aboard the state-of-the-art deep submergence vehicle to a depth of 10,928 meters.
Without proper management, technology will dominate us.
The changes that the revolution creates are rapid and global scale.
Companies can no longer act as if external factors, such as environmental damage or social unrest, do not exist or are not their own responsibility.
It's as same as companies that don't act are pointing guns at their feet.
In conclusion, we must understand that the fourth industrial revolution will not only affect our industry but also society and the lives of all mankind.
Much of the current order based on international covenants also needs to be amended.
However, there are important roles for governments and individuals to play.
Governments and international organizations also need to reorganize the Bretton Woods agreement with the United Nations that shaped the world in which we live.
Some of the leading global conglomerates dealing with consumers have become the sacrificial lamb of information leakage, causing hundreds of millions of consumers to suffer.
The court, however, defined Christian universities as "organizations whose main mission is to educate the set of moral values."
The nature of Christian education pursued by the Christian university and the clarity of the spiritual identity of the Christian university are important factors in resolving the problem.
A disciplined student filed a lawsuit against the university, claiming that the university, which receives direct and indirect financial support from the federal and state governments, limited his basic rights.
A U.S. court ruled that rights of Christian universities cannot be restricted because their decisions cannot be regarded the same as the decisions of the state or government agencies.
Christian universities have guidebooks and manuals for implementing religious education for students, which can be said to have implicit contracts between universities and students.
According to this law, there is a clear difference between restricting freedom of expression within private universities, including Christian universities, and limiting freedom of expression within public universities.
It is more efficient to choose a multi-model (a product that controls several stand-type and wall-mounted indoor units as one outdoor unit) by looking at half of the actual floor space as cooling average water.
"If problems occur during the installation process, the cooling performance may degrade due to gas leaks or water may flow into the floor."
"People usually install their upright air conditioner in the living room, as the size of the living room doesn't usually exceed half of the total area of an apartment or a detached house."
There is also a cost for charging the refrigerant gas after the piping is connected.
The battle to secure air conditioners is expected again this year due to the faster summer and the disappearing spring.
It is a disease in which melanin pigment is not synthesized in the eyes and skin of animals and people.
A pair of swallows that flew this spring laid eggs and four cracked the egg around 15 days ago. Three were black and the other was white all over.
A white-colored swallow appeared in Jinan-gun, Jeonbuk.
I got to know it as the town chief told me. At first I thought that the white swallow was the downy of the swallow.
A white swallow known as a symbol of good luck was born on the eaves of a Chinese restaurant in Mayeong-myeon, Jinan-gun, Jeonbuk.
Although getting it resolved would not be easy since there is a massive difference in position between North Korea-Japan, the attempt itself for a conversation is expected to have a positive impact on the situation of the Korean peninsula.
This bothered others but me.
Regarding the denuclearization of North Korea and the relations between North Korea-US, the US Department of State also said on the 24th, "We are still ready to get involved in a constructive discussion with North Korea for the simultaneous/parallel progress," adhering to its original position.
It is a positive sign that the leaders of the US and Japan issued a "conversation and negotiation" message to North Korea with a single voice, at a time when tensions have been rising due to the North's recent launch of short-range missiles.
Regarding the issue of Japanese abductees, it is also noteworthy that Abe expressed his willingness to hold a summit between North Korea and Japan, saying, "I want to meet with Kim Jong-un, the chairman of the Cabinet, and talk frankly and candidly."
One day morning, on my way home from dawn prayer , there was a brilliant sunshine.
The church grew younger as evangelism was passed on through the children.
As mothers left their children on the way to the market, they began to get closer to their families.
It was a farm road where only one car could barely pass.
The children's voices somehow created an atmosphere of excitement and entertainment.
From a parent's point of view, as a child grows up, everyone starts to worry.
One spends money and time on what one needs.
The world looked so beautiful that I couldn't open my eyes.
He said the North's concessions are necessary because Seoul is too close to the Military Demarcation Line to allow the South Korean military to step back any longer.
If North Korea fires long-range artillery guns all at once in case of emergency, shells could rain down to Seoul and south Gyeonggi-do Province.
Since the collapse of the North Korea-U.S. summit in Hanoi, a proposal to rearrange North Korea's long-range artillery aimed at the Seoul metropolitan area has been made as a way to break the deadlock in relations between Pyongyang and Washington.
He claimed that the excessive inter-Korean military confrontation requires "work to remove steam from the pressure cooker" as heightened military tensions between the two Koreas could trigger an "accidental war."
Kim Yeong-jun, a professor at the Graduate School of Defense Management of the Korea National Defense University, said in the same seminar, "the September 19th military agreement is not something new that the progressive government created based on the policy of radical leftist idealism.
It means that the order of the procedure is changed because it requires the prosecution to first prove the suspicion for the search warrant to see if there is a criminal charge.
I have never heard of a controversy occurring over fairness in the prosecution investigation because of the final responsibility of the prosecutor in investigating disputes among ordinary people and the investigation order system that can require the prosecution to be supplemented.
When you design laws and institutions, what is absolutely forbidden is the attitude that you just try them and solve the problem just after they are revealed, or you put up with it because there are a few side effects.
There's nothing free in the world, and it's a matter of fact that if you owe it, you have to pay it back.
It is about whether the prosecution reform bill currently being pushed by the National Assembly is surgery for patients based on an accurate diagnosis of the affected, and if the system is introduced, whether political neutrality and fairness will be secured on their own.
This is because there are concerns that the public prosecutors may be cruel by being overly righteous, and the executive may be wary of the person in charge of human resources affairs because of the possible disadvantage in personnel affairs.
If you sincerely want to reform, I think you should not blame the prosecutor's personality and demand that all prosecutors be scholars, but I think that the system should be improved so that no problems arise based on such human nature.
In particular, when it is a national concern and a result contrary to common sense, the investigating agency may be criticized for conducting an investigation.
When the police continue their investigation without completing it within a certain period of time, the side effects will be minimized if their investigation is immediately controlled by prosecutors and if they are even allowed to order commitment.
It is said that when a person takes off the clothes of power, he or she is fully exposed, and so the personality and the ability can be verified.
Regarding the bill on the adjustment of the investigative right of the prosecution and the police, a bill which is being discussed at the National Assembly, Song In-taek (56, 21st graduate of the Judicial Research and Training Institute), head of the Ulsan District Prosecutors' Office, sent an e-mail to all lawmakers, which include the criticism saying that it is no different from the dismantling of the Coast Guard during the Sewol ferry disaster.
Pointing out that the power of the prosecution is a structure focused on the Public Prosecutor Genera, the minister of the Department of Justice and the Cheongwadae, district attorney Song put together and presented nine specific measures to reform the prosecution.
In the case of unjust or human rights violation investigation occur, by being ahead of the will or succumbing to the direction of the superior, the system to reprimand the prosecutor should also be introduced.
It is also noteworthy that the Green Party's affiliation has become a sensation in the upcoming election.
As far-right wings advocating anti-European Union and anti-immigration and a green party line calling for a government response to climate change made a leap in the 2019 European Parliament elections, moderates which have led European integration have lost power compared to the past.
In order to keep the majority of the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists, which have been leading the EU, they have to work with another middle-class group, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), which supports European integration.
In particular, with the rise of far-right parties in major European countries such as the United Kingdom and France, established political forces have lost ground.
In the United Kingdom, 46 of the 73 seats allocated in the morning of the 27th were counted, and the Far Right Brexit took 21, followed by the Liberal Democrats with 10.
The recent calls for the government's active response to climate change seem to reflect the growing mood in Europe.
If the status of only one requirement is maintained, it is expected to fall out of the status of the monitored country as early as the second half of the year.
"We understand that the move does not have a significant impact on the exchange rate report on Korea yet," said an official at the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
In particular, the US Department of Commerce has not elaborated on whether the measure overlaps with the Department of Treasury's retaliatory tariffs on currency manipulators, and what the specific imposition standards are.
However, as US countervailing tariff criteria are not clear yet, we are waiting and seeing whether a high rate tariff will be imposed even if it didn't manipulate exchange rate.
Countervailing duty is a measure that imposes a customs duty on a product that caused damage becaus it has much price competitiveness with government subsidies.
The U.S. Department of Commerce said that trading partners deliberately lowered monetary values, then it is a "subsidy" to protect its industry.
The US has been accused of artificially lowering its currencies not only in China but also in Korea and Japan.
In the Incheon area, 10 schools had school scouts, but almost all gave "Very Good" or "Good" evaluations in the categories of "Preventing School Violence, Sexual Violence and Child Abuse," and "Creating a Human Rights-Friendly School Culture."
According to the Kookmin Ilbo's analysis of the evaluation results of 84 schools where Me Too controversy was raised last year, it was revealed on the 29th that none of them mentioned self-reflection on the matter or the issue of self-purification.
One school commented on the weakness and wrote that "we should focus on educational activities to prevent cyber-school violence that is frequently occurring among girls."
Although the teacher made sexually harassing remarks such as "Your back is so pretty" and "Your butt is so pretty" to his students, his self-assessment was self-fulfilling.
"The formation of a peaceful learing community has been successful, where students trust their teachers and teachers respect their students," said high school B in Goyang, Gyeonggi-do, which inflicted additional damage to the person who reported about School Me Too by pressuring him/her to delete the contents which he/she posted on SNS.
This is the result of school evaluations recently posted on the elementary, middle and high school education information portal website "School Notification" by by major schools that were accused of sexual violence in schools, i.e. "School Me Too" last year.
On the contrary, many have commented that they have created a human rights-friendly culture.
At first he said, "I do not think my memory is clear, but I will do my best to solve it," then, when the article that started the accusation was deleted, he changed his stance and said, "The person who posted the message must be held accountable for his indescribable insult and defamation."
After the agency released its first statement of position, there was comment on a netizen claiming the damage, saying "The person who claimed the damage was also the perpetrator of school violence."
When a netizen revealed that Hyolyn, a singer from the group Sistar, was the bully who did school violence when she was a student, swept the Internet, the agency said its position on two times.
Hyo-rin's agency, which released a different stance, by suffering from that after the revelations were spread through internet, they became the articles, and then were deleted, concluded the first and second stance statement with the same sentence, "I'm sorry for causing trouble."
She once sent a message on Hyolyn's Instagram asking her to apologize, but said she did not reply, adding that she wanted to receive Hyolyn's sincere apology.
There were mixed views on President Moon's influence over the nomination process.
Former lawmaker Kim Sung-ho said, "If conservative integration is achieved, there is a possibility that the former party leaders Yoo Seung-min and Ahn Cheol-soo will participate and have a nomination share."
With the 21st general elections to be held on April 15 next year, the biggest concern within and outside political circles is "who leads the nomination process."
Next, two representatives including Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon and floor leader Lee In-young of the Democratic Party, and each representative, including Noh Young-min Chief Secretary of Cheong Wa Dae and Kang Gi-jeong, head of the State Affairs Committee, Strategic Planning Committee Chairman Lee Geun-hyung of Democratic Party (former Cheong Wa Dae Public Opinion Secretary).
One of the reasons to highly appreciate the impact of the director Yang Jeong Cheol is that he is a representative who can read President Moon's intention.
The New Korea Party, led by former-president Kim Young-sam, did very well in the 15th general elections in 1996, the fourth year of his term, using broad members including Kim Moon-soo, Hong Jun-pyo, and Lee Jae-oh.
The New Millennium Democratic Party, led by former President Kim Dae-jung, laid the foundation for the progressive regime to return to power by transfusing "blood of the young" including 86 generations of democratization movements, including Lim Jong-seok, during the 16th general nomination.
Critics point out that the 'Act On The Honorable Treatment Of And Support For Persons, etc. Of Distinguished Service To The State' limits the scope of bereaved families who receive compensation to grandchildren, which does not properly honor the descendants of independence fighters.
According to the documents that Democratic Party member Choi Woon-youl received from the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs, veterans' children or grandchildren that are over the age of 60 constitute 73% of the total as of the end of last year.
"Since the law limits people who receive support from the state to grandchildren, we don't have any generation data since then," said an official at the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs said.
All 448 great-grandchildren and nine great-great-grandchildren who registered when their children and grandchildren died is the only numbers that are known to them.
They say that although the elderly descendants are belatedly benefiting from the life support system implemented since last year, the "passed down poverty" has been fixed because the generation after that are not applicable for the support.
Many in political circles also call for expanding the scope of descendants of independence fighters.
Another problem is that the great-grandchildren of independence fighters lose their pride in their ancestors.
As the anti-Japanese movement began in earnest, he exiled to China to fight for armed struggle and foster independent forces.
It is the great-grandchildren and grandchildren who are in a time of need for tuition support.
A study of permanent rental apartments in the country by the author also confirmed that the higher the resident on the higher floor, the higher the suicide rate than the resident on the lower floor.
There are few high-rise apartments in European or American residential areas.
Even if the same number of households are built in the same area, the building-to-land ratio should be high by building smaller buildings closer together rather than building taller buildings sparsely.
High-rise residents have relatively less interaction with their neighbors.
Desire to build an apartment absolutely high has similar aspects to it.
Research teams from Cornell University in the U.S. and the University of British Columbia in Canada studied all the research which have done worldwide about the impact of high-rise apartments on humans.
It is the logic which put the money on the priority that high-rise apartments are well-sold and good business.
On this basis, 'Social Common Good' is formed, and 'Social Support' to reach out to the difficulties of neighbors and others and participate in solving social problems increases.
We are making such decisions that if we could have higher business values, we don't mind our families suffering from mental illnesses or broken our society.
The problem is that there is a surge in the cases of public high schools in the United States, which give extra time or allow separate testing sites for the SAT and ACT tests.
The loans they received debt relief amount to $ 111.1 billion.
University education is shaking as the US college entrance exams have lost their confidence.
In particular, the wealthy and white people appear to be increasing greatly in areas where there is a suspicion that it has been exploited for entrance examination.
The gap between high school and college graduates is widening, so they are going to college. However, they will receive large loans for a student every semester due to skyrocketing tuition fees.
As of the first half of this year, 11.4 percent of college graduates turned out to be unable to pay back their student loans for 90 days, or more than three months.
The most important thing in the U.S. college entrance exam is the GPA in high school, and the essay, shortly written by test takers, is also important.
High school students in the U.S. can choose one or both to apply for by pre-emptively figuring out what they want from the university they want to go to.
The U.S. economic indicators, including the lowest unemployment rate in a half a century, are showing signs of brisk activity, but the starting salary of college graduates falls short of expectations.
Student loans in arrears and insolvency of U.S. college graduates have soared during the economic downturn, but have fallen since the recession ended about ten years ago.
More than one out of 10 college students who even owe a pile of student debts are unable to pay back on time after graduation and falling into arrears or insolvency.
In the U.S., college graduates, who have graduated from college in May and are starting their careers, enjoy the luck of getting a job more easily than in previous years, but their wages are virtually the same, disappointing them.
In areas where the rich and white live, parents are likely to pressure or lobby schools to get more test hours or even allow them to take tests at separate test centers.
For example, three hours of test time are given, plus a significant additional time, about 40 minutes.
The Wall Street Journal criticized that, at many public high schools, the rich and white students abuse the systems allowing the disabled to have benefits while taking a test, such as additional time or a separate test center, for admission frauds.
There are two main cases when public schools are allowed to apply for preferential benefits.
Among Americans with student loans, 29%, or the largest portion, are between $20,000 and $40,000, 23 % below $20,000 and 18 % above $40,000.
It is not a large number in reflection of the scale of the Korean economy, but it must be taken into account that Mid and Long-term Damage, which will appear after the economic growth of Britain and the EU slows down, have not been considered yet.
Standard & Poor's, S & P, expected future negotiations to be difficult, saying, "The next prime minister is likely to take a stronger stand than May."
"The only way to avoid getting fired from voters is to respect the outcome of the 2016 referendum and come out of the EU," he directly wrote in a column to the Telegraph on 27th (Korea time).
The real implication of English Prime Minister Teresa May's resignation as prime minister is that there is a greater likelihood of a "No Deal Brexit" which means Britain's withdrawal from the EU without agreement.
According to Bloomberg on the 27th, the probability of No Deal Brexit, which was around 10% until the middle of this month, surged to 33% after Prime Minister May announced her resignation.
The possibility of 'no deal' and 'negotiations' has grown because former Prime Minister Johnson is to be referred to as the new prime minister, who has stressed his intention on leaving EU saying, "Brinkmanship is better than agreement."
In the domestic financial investment industry, it is said that "we have never experienced it once", and that there is a concern about impacts caused by the Brexit than the trade conflicts between the US and China.

After fighting between workers and the self-employed at minimum wage, the self-employed are now on our side and say building owners and distribution companies are really a deep-rooted evil.
The question is whether there is a program to effectively use financial resources?
Some emphasize the limitations of the “signage policy” of income-driven growth, while others stress the lack of specific action plans and implementation.
We must abandon the foolhardiness that the government can lead growth.
While you also raise your voice to the government that I am the underdog, the real underdogs that have not been organized are being pushed out on the periphery.
First of all, the boundaries of government's role and activities should be clear.
New job openings have decreased due to the regularization of public enterprises and self-employment and small manufacturing jobs have decreased due to the increase in the minimum wage and the ban on overtime work for 52 hours a week.
The Ministry of Employment and Labor's measure to remove the ladder from the workplace was at its peak as there were many accidents.
In particular, if participating companies are currently negotiating or conducting export contracts with overseas buyers, they will be able to invite their counterpart buyer to "It's Game."

The reason is that Kim's accident does not fall under the criteria of one-way negligence based on the current ratio of car accidents.
Like in Kim's case, an accident caused by sudden passing in the same lane was previously charged 20% to the victim, but now the assailant will be 100% responsible.
According to the amendment, 33 criteria under which one-way negligence is applied to the offender are newly established and changed.
A car that was following intruded into the center line to forcefully pass Kim's car, and caused a collision.
Kim expressed, "I was the victim of a car crash while personally driving safely in the right lane at the prescribed speed, so I don't know why I should be held accountable for the accident."
A high court judge on the 26th explained, "The appeals court, a legal trial, examines that the judgment is not wrong based on the evidence adopted by the lower court."
The amount of bribery recognized by appeals tribunal of Lee Jae-yong, the vice-chairman of the Samsung Electronics, and the amount of bribes received, recognized by appeals tribunal of former President Park Geun-hye, have differences more than twice.
Attention is being paid to whether the Supreme Court's final decision on the three core members (Park Geun-hye, Lee Jae-yong and Choi Soon-sil) of the case of Samsung bribery of manipulation of state affairs will be made as early as next month.
"Even if it is a trial at the Supreme Court, we have no choice but to look at the case comprehensively, and the suspicion of Samsung Biologics, including an opinion letter from an independent counsel, could affect the judge's conviction," said a lawyer who served as a presiding judge.
The fate of Vice-President Lee who had been released with probation at the trial on an appeal case can once again change depending on which side the Supreme Court stands on.
The main issue of making difference in the amount of bribe, which the trial on an appeal case acknowledged, is whether the succession of Samsung's management rights existed and to whom the 3 high-class horses that Samsung gave to Chung Yoo-ra, the daughter of Choi, belonged.

In fact, Cho Ye-sun, a student from Sichuan Province who joined the department of performing arts at Incheon National University as a third grader, is drawing keen attention because of the possibility of her success as an entertainer.
Sichuan province, where Yi Baek (701-762) and Dubo (712-770), who are revered as China's best literary artists, was born, is still famous by the great lakes such as Wang Mong.

In an era where many people can access lots of content from their homes through Netflix, plays have become an art that requires time and effort.
On the stage, the set reproduced like a miniature turns round and round to various spaces such as the present house and the apartment of childhood.
The play is not just communication but should form a consensus.
Perhaps that was affected by his process of growth.
In the meantime, there was no opportunity to meet Lepage who appeared as an actor in Korea.
For this reason, the Korean Teachers & Educational Workers' Union became the target of intensive attacks by the conservative government and conservative media, and the frame of ”pro-North, left-wing and red” was mobilized.
Drawing on the participation of young union members and carrying out an educational campaign with citizens is a task that the 30-year-old the Korean Teachers & Educational Workers' Union should solve.
CEO Kim ordered that the "Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union should take the lead in on-site issues such as the substitution system, teacher evaluation rights, and new conflicts arising from the conflicts between student rights and school rights."
"It's a matter that teachers, students and parents have to consider together, but I don't want them to point an arrow at the other side or put priority only on teachers' right to education," said Kim Hyo-jung, a parent.
He stressed that, just as Cheong Wa Dae directly collects public opinion in a way of petition, the Korean Teachers and Educational Workers' Union should not rely too much on the delegate convention system and strengthen communication with teachers on the ground through social networking services.
Although it is not denying the faults of the offspring, the words of the presiding judge became a warm consolation to the mother whose heart was nailed by her child’s momentary mistake.

In recent years, as the tax avoidance technique has been advanced and intelligentized, a proposal has been made to introduce an 'aggressive tax strategy compulsory reporting system' to prevent tax evasion that exploits the loopholes of the current law.
Researcher Kim said, however, that it is necessary to clearly set the concept and scope of the "tax strategy" so that the contents that the positive law is trying to regulate are not interpreted or applied in a multifaceted manner.
The system has a duty to report to the taxation authority if a tax accountant or accountant plans an aggressive tax strategy for the benefit of customers by taking advantage of loopholes in the tax code.
He explained objective effects and academic grounds through the practice of treating real patients with a mechanism in which Chuna Manual Therapy works on facial muscles.

In particular, some in the ruling camp point out that the case should be used as an opportunity to correct discipline among civil servants under the Moon administration in its third year in office.
All previous governments suffered from "3rd-year syndrome", in which their grip on civil servants weakens and a leak of power begins when they enter into the 3rd year in power.
It seems that the government and the ruling party are emphasizing it being the deviation of individuals because they believe that there could be backfire if the government and the ruling party revealed that discipline in public offices has slackened.
It has been reported that the investigation into such things as the purpose of business trips of some high-ranking government officials, who frequently visit Seoul, showed that some of them were found to have committed deviations, such as drunk driving and going to hostess bars.
Concerns are growing over possible lax discipline in officialdom as a result of the leak of phone conversations between South Korean and U.S. leaders by an government official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Young members of the Liberty Korea Party, born between early 1980s and early 2000s, gave a sober assessment such as "There are no strategies to attract the middle class," and "Its decision-making structure is rigid and vertical."
In particular, some predict that lawmakers' voices raising different opinions from the leadership could be further dampened as the ruling and opposition parties intensify their confrontation ahead of the general elections.
Many observers say that if the Liberty Korea Party only focuses on rallying existing supporters without any significant reform before the general election, it will be difficult to win the centrist votes.
Lawmaker Yoo Ki-joon and Joo Ho-young, who demanded reformation to the then party representative Park Geun-hye at the Wednesdays Meeting for New Politics, do not have any tendency to reform in the party, as they have become fourth-term veterans.

As of 2017, there have been 56,000 cases of the inter-vehicle accidents which take place between cars insured by the same insurance company, but they should go through lawsuits due to bare possibilities to arbitrate in a dispute.
The new criteria for negligence ratios became more strict, showing that on the congested road if a motorcycle entering a roundabout along the edge of its right side was hit by a car entering the roundabout from the opposite side or the outer side, the motorcycle would have 70 percent of the negligence ratio.
Objective criteria will be set for the agreement on the ratio of negligence even when an accident occurs on a bicycle-only road, with a bicycle being hit, or on a roundabout.
If a car on the left turn crossroad goes straight and a car on the straight and left turn crossroad goes left, and an accident occurs while the car on the turns left, the car on the left is currently subject to 10 percent negligence.
They decided to deem the car as making a 100 percent mistake if it hits a left-turn vehicle, which was in front while receiving signals for a straight and left turn.

Until now, there have been many complaints from consumers that property insurance companies have intentionally induced both parties even for accidents that the victims could not avoid.

One of the matches won 20 points in the expedition even when Leonard disguise.
Milwaukee, driven to the cliff until the end of the game, was in high spirits.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has finalized the granting of a disease code called "Gaming Disorder," and the health authorities in each country have a justification for making games for medical treatment target.
After the registration of the disease code was confirmed, the domestic game industry was strongly opposed to it.
If a game is defined as an addictive substance to be cured, game-related regulations may become more resilient and higher taxes such as tobacco may be imposed.
According to the amendment, "game use disorder" is considered to be game addiction if the game control ability is impaired and the game is more important than every day and the phenomenon of being immersed in the game lasts more than 12 months.
The South Korean government is said to have called for a set of standards for medical intervention, saying, "We need a policy basis for prevention and treatment of excessive immersion in games in remarks by countries."
In particular, since the Ministry of Health and Welfare has expressed its willingness to accept WHO's policy, there are concerns that the revision will serve as an opportunity to impose a levy on game companies in the name of treatment for addiction.
In particular, the Korean government has been actively supporting the passage of the amendment to the game use disorder at the general meeting, raising complaints in the game industry.
For the increase of wage, as the government promised to raise the fare for buses in the city, labor and management will voluntarily consult according to it.
The strike crisis has been settled for the time being after four city bus companies in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, which demanded the introduction of semi-public system, wage raises, and extension of retirement age and forewarned the strike, agreed to some of the requirements with the management.
Since then, discussions between labor and management have been held across the country a day before the expected date of the strike, but bus management and labor in the Cheongju area have failed to consult and had extended the adjustment period to the 24th.
The labor union demanded the company for introduction of quasi-public operating system, wage increase, preservation of wage reduction according to 52-hour work per week system, extension of retirement age, and transition of drivers' burden for premium into the company's burden.
The semipublic system is to compensate for the deficit of bus companies instead of having the local governments take control of the route.

According to the National Assembly on the 27th, among the 7 laws against illegal recruitment of bank industries, no legislation passed by the National Assembly has been counted to date.
It has been a year and a half since the banks' employment fraud was first known in the world, but the hiring fraud prevention law to prevent another hiring fraud has not passed the National Assembly.
Hiring fraud scandal in the bank was known in October, 2017, when Shim Sang-jung, a member of the Justice Party revealed allegations of hiring corruption in Woori Bank to the inspection of the government offices.
In the Unjust Employment Prevention Act in National Assembly, the first things we can see are Partial Revision For Justification Of Employment Processes, that are proposed by Kim Gwan-young, Son Geum-ju, Shim Sang-jeong, respectively.

Hemorrhoids are created when the lymphatic system, located under the anus skin and the mucous membrane, is stretched and anal fistula is created when the skin around anus has a dent of pus (a fistulous opening).

The allegations raised were found to be neither illegal nor true.
Lawmaker Shim read some budget materials that the government did not disclose in the internal system of the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit in October last year, and raised various suspicions based on the data.
It was found that former deputy director Shin's disclosure did not constitute an official secret, and at the same time did not contain any facts or illegalities related to the contents.
Kim Tae-woo, a former investigator who worked for the presidential office's special inspection team, started the disclosure campaign in December last year based on intelligence he collected while working at the presidential office.
When the revelation began, Cheong Wa Dae had directly filed a complaint with the prosecution against Kim.
Budget Disclosure War, which Shim Jae-chul, lawmaker of the Liberty Korea Party, waged last year against the Blue House, was put to an end as the prosecution ruled that the indictment was suspended.
On the other hand, there was a time when both ended in innocence.
This means that it was admitted that lawmaker Shim was partially charged with illegally leaking the government's undisclosed and unauthorized budget data, but the prosecution did not indict him/her after comprehensively judging various circumstances.
Former deputy director Shin claimed on YouTube last December that the Blue House forced the issuance of deficit state bonds and also intervened in personnel appointments of private companies.

Professor Roh Sung-won, a professor of mental health at Hanyang University Hospital, said, "Among experts, we concluded that game addiction can be explained by a model similar to other addictions such as drugs and alcohol. Accumulated related research has led to classifying it as a disease".
If loss of control function toward games and prioritizing game over other interests in life and daily life, along with occurrence of negative results due to game, but not being able to stop playing games continued for at least 12 months, it was considered as game addiction.

The reason why overtime in the gaming industry can be more prevalent is that most game developers are game lovers.
The game is typically an ambiguous area where there is a distinction between work and hobbies.
The game industry's Crunch Mode has become an important issue in North America recently.
It was because it had been common for them to keep their lights on even and work, even when employees of all the neighboring companies left work.

If the consular assistance law, which was promulgated this year, takes effect in January 2021, the role of the consular call center will be expanded further, Kang said. "When the foreign ministry consults the budget, we are considering expanding the number of staff at the center."

The reason for the backlash is that housing prices will fall if the third new city is located closer to Seoul, despite the slow development of promised infrastructure such as transportation.

Those who gave their children their house at a low price to avoid taxes or want to get on the last train before the price plunged due to the announcement of a plan for the 3rd new town rushed to put up their houses on the market for sale.

An exhibition was held in Costa Rica, followed by Sao Paulo.
Among them, the painting of three grandchildren as three cute monkeys in the face of the monkey year is the favorite of the grandfather who likes to draw at once.
I also have an Instagram account in my bookstore.
The article was translated into English by their son Ji-byol and into Brazilian by their daughter Mi-ru in Brazilian.
When I first discovered this account, I was more impressed by the fact that the elderly had mastered the process of Instagram than by the explosive popularity.
She/he raised her son Ji-byul and daughter Lee Mi-ru(44), and over time, she/he was greeted by three grandchildren: Arthur (15), Alan (14), and Astro (4).

So far, the technology gap between the U.S. and China is still large, but the U.S. government can be seen as a threat that it could be overtaken sooner or later unless it stops China from acting now.
The U.S.-China trade war, in which tariffs are used as a weapon, is likely to be temporarily sealed this year, but experts say that the competition for technological supremacy will continue and intensify further.
On April 3 last year, shortly after the report was released, the Trump administration imposed 25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods worth $50 Billion (53 trillion won).
In other words, the survival of U.S. technology companies that have focused on designing high value-added concepts and outsourced low value-added manufacturing industries to China and other countries is at stake.
There is also a view that if China is equipped with high-tech manufacturing, it may bring a crack of the existing dollar hegemony system which is the core of US hegemony.
On the 21st, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the March Departure Memorial Monument in Yudu County, Jiangxi Province, where the Red Army (former of the People's Liberation Army) took the first step of the "Long March " in the 1930s.

In particular, it is easy for companies to collect necessary information as China has lax privacy regulations compared to advanced countries such as the U.S. and Europe.
Major telecommunications companies, including Google, Intel, and Qualcomm, announced plans to stop supplying services and chips to Huawei.

The government maintains that KEPCO's deficit has nothing to do with its policy to suspend nuclear power generation or expand renewable energy, but no one believes it at face value.
The denuclearization policy, which had been decided on a rush by the political purpose of bringing the Green Party to the coalition government without sufficient discussion, was faced with a strong backlash.
Deloitte, a global consulting firm, stressed that "if the EU keeps the ratio of nuclear power generation to 25% of the total power generation by 2050, it not only achieves the GHG reduction target but also has economic growth and job creation effect."
Spiegel said renewable energy generation, including wind and solar power, is irregular depending on the weather, leading to power shortages.
Spiegel noted that the German government has spent 160 billion euros (209 trillion won) to reduce nuclear power and increase renewable energy over the last five years, but coal generation is a significant part of the generation.
It is emphasized that the disadvantage is too great if it gives up nuclear power plants that generate far less carbon dioxide than coal power.
Before I came, my sister lived with several puppies.
My sister was in charge of mixing kimchi soup, bean paste stew, fish heads, and anything to bring to them in the yard.
My sister told me that she didn't even know how old the dogs were.
However, he said, "Bbobbi was a male, Yebbi was a female, and Geomdungi was a rather ugly male to be called a puppy because of his size."
Such things would have happened everywhere, and it would not be said to be completely gone now that the pet population is 10 million.
He said he poured white plain rice, chips and sometimes precious white milk without letting elders notice, but mostly those were salty, spicy and spiny foods.

The public is harshly criticizing Han Ji-sun, who was an unknown actress until yesterday.
There have been criticisms about whether she has appeared in several works as minor acts and supporting roles, but since she has not been known to the public, she has continued her activities with the simple idea of "unless the fact that punishment is revealed."
We are not the National Intelligence Service and we can not investigate.
As he does not communicate with fans through SNS, Han Ji-seon's official position so far is only an apology issued by his agency.
The SBS "The Secret Life of My Secretary", which she is appearing, reportedly gathered opinions by canceling and getting off the filming of the amount of Han Ji-sun on the 24th.
The most difficult job always falls to the team leader.
I discovered this phenomenon while observing students form study groups.
People when choosing a job consider mainly three factors.
"A person who is better than oneself" that Confucius says is not a person who has more money, or has a higher social status or so-called power.
There was a team leader A who devoted himself and worked for the company.

The analogy of Wise Honest to the BDA is interpreted as an indirect indication of the North Korea's intention that denuclearization negotiations will be possible in the future only after the return of the ship is resolved first, as it was the case then.
The six-party talks broke down when the North protested the freezing of funds and responded with its first nuclear test in October 2006, but the talks resumed after the U.S. transferred the frozen funds to the North in June 2007.
The newspaper criticized the application of the U.S. law as an "unlawful act that goes against the U.N. Charter and international law," saying that the Wise Honest is an asset of the Joseon Dynasty and an area where Joseon's sovereignty is exercised, and the robbery of this is a violent violation of its sovereignty."
The UNSC's sanctions resolution on North Korea allows only the detention of ships that carry the sanctioned items, which is an allegation that the U.S. acted excessively to seize the vessels based on its own laws to circumvent this.
"The U.S. is playing a dangerous game by creating the ember of confrontation even before the third round of the North Korea-U.S. summit talk is held," the newspaper said in the article "the seizure of ship, the ember of confrontation that the U.S. manipulated."
The Joseon Sinbo, the bulletin of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, which represents North Korea's position, on the 24th accused the U.S. of seizing its cargo ship "Wise Honest" even before the third U.S.-North Korea summit was held, raising an "ember of confrontation" between the U.S. and North Korea.
President Donald Trump said he had received legal counsel to prevent Lind from being prematurely released.
Foreign Policy cited the 2017 National Terror Center report, saying that "he continued to defend global Islamic extremist groups and write and translate violent extremist groups around the world".
Washington Post columnist Jason Lezaian pointed out that Lind was released early according to the correct legal process, in a column titled "Linde shows that law is the most powerful weapon against terrorism."
He was soon captured in a skirmish with the Northern Alliance of the local anti-Taliban coalition and handed over to the U.S. military and taken to a detention center near Mazar-Isharif in northern Afghanistan.
It seems that public opinion about Lind will affect them as well.
He has to be compulsorily examined by psychiatrists and cannot access extremist Islamic materials as well as possess them.
In this situation, it is argued that Lind, who had been released in 17 years, still could not abandon extremism.
Lawmaker Lee was put on trial in April 2009 after the Chosun Ilbo filed a suit to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office on defamation charges against Lee because he said that "president of the Chosun Ilbo is included in the Jang Ja-yeon list" during a parliamentary interpellation session in March 2009.
Prosecutors have launched an investigation into the case of the alleged perjury of the CEO of the late Jang Ja-yeon's agency, which was recommended by the prosecution's the truth and reconciliation committee (TRC) under the Ministry of Justice.
On the 20th, Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommended the prosecution to initiate the investigation on charges of perjury of Kim in the defamation trial of Democratic Party of Korea lawmakers Lee Jong-Gul which was opened in November 2012.
The Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office said on the 24th that they have assigned the case of the allegation of perjury of Kim Jong-seung, the CEO of Jang's agency, into which the truth and reconciliation committee recommended an investigation, to the first department of investigation in the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office (chief Kim Jong-bum).
Kim testified at the trial, saying "I and Jang went to a dinner meeting presided over by Bang Yong-hoon, president of the Koreana Hotel of the Chosun Ilbo in October 2007, and I found out who Bang was after Jang died."
In the winter, people in the north area could load their sleds and trade with the surrounding area along the frozen river.
Archaeological data prove that very advanced civilizations existed in Siberia and northern Manchuria, which were neighboring to us, although not far into the Arctic Ocean.
Between 1998 and 2002, as a result of the investigation on specific area which is only one-fifth of the Sanjiang Plains, it found 200 sites of the castle, including Fenglin St.
The SanJiang Pingyuan won has the next largest black earth distric after Ukraine.
Since then, it has been common to invade the grasslands again by growing power.
The northernmost ruins of the people of Buyeo line were discovered.
These stories, so-called “Northern mythology,” have narrative structures that people descend from the sky, and northern areas are used as similar meanings of sky.
Genetic analysis has shown that the people most similar to the Pazyryk, a representative nomadic people in the Altai region, are native Siberian Hanti and Mansi.
At first glance, these seemingly contradictory images reveal the prejudice and illusion of people against the North barracks that have been around for thousands of years.
The general analysis is that the U.S. is trying to check Huawei, which is leading next-generation mobile communication technology.
Chinese Head of State Xi Jinping's visit to South Korea in June was reportedly canceled due to the prolonged stalemate in negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea and intensifying trade disputes between the U.S. and China.
At the end of next month, the summit of Korea and USA is scheduled.
However, the situation is not much different in that the South Korean government has to engage in exquisite tightrope diplomacy between the U.S. and China.
If the THAAD deployment was a sovereign decision directly related to national security, this case is different in that it is essentially an economic issue between the U.S. and China, where companies are the main players.
"South Korea is in a situation where it has to choose between conflicting demands from the U.S. and China, and that is expected to continue for the time being," said Shin Beom-chul, head of the Center for Security and Unification at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies.
Since Head of State Xi is likely to visit North Korea first before visiting South Korea, the schedule for his visit to South Korea is expected to be discussed on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of diplomatic ties between North Korea and China in October.
Although it is difficult to directly compare the deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in South Korea, there are concerns that South Korea could be caught between the U.S. and China again and suffer economic damage.
The possibility cannot be ruled out that U.S. President Donald Trump, who is visiting Korea at the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan, will discuss the issue in earnest at the Korea-U.S. summit.
A variety of military dance performances, ranging from the Three Kingdoms Period to the costumes of the time of enlightenment, a parade of Military Academy band, and a parade prepared by residents of 16 districts in Jungnang-gu will be staged.
An official of the district said, "You can meet 10 million roses as there are usually about 50 roses blooming per stock."
The Jungnang-gu Rose Festival is a case where a small neighborhood festival has been reborn as a representative festival in Seoul.
The hanbok fashion show and hanbok flash mob, which will be modeled by foreign sponsors, are expected to offer both the beauty of hanbok and an exotic spectacle.
The 2019 Seoul Rose Festival is being held in whole Jungnangcheon, Jungnang-gu, Seoul.
It is preparing for global festivals such as mutual exchanges, attracting performances, and operating promotional booths with other countries around the world, as it is possible to blossom roses during the four seasons when different varieties are available and the hands of experts are applied.
It goes beyond just a passive dimension without greed, and is angry about injustice and uncompromising with it and does not corrupt itself.
"You must be the people’s representative before God and bring their disputes to him." This means that Moses must bring people's problems before God rather than decide the problem by himself.
To the father in-law whom he had met for a long time, Moses told how God had delivered the Hebrew slaves from the hands of Egypt, and Jethro was greatly pleased.
Exodus 18 tells the story of Moses and his father-in-law Jethro.
The truth is that the people come to Moses with a problem because they want to hear God's answer, not Moses.
The father-in-law who was watching all this talks to Moses.
Moses, who lost Pharaoh's army, which was the strongest in that time, and opened up a road to Canaan, the promised land with honey and mil, had unconditional support and veneration.
Under the ambition of director Kang, the KNB movement, a choreographer training project launched in 2015, is already expanding the territory of Korean ballet.
It was chosen as a repertoire based on his belief that ballet must have more choice to reach out to the wider public, just as some people like bread and sausages and others like vegetables.
He decided to give up his life-long guaranteed job as a member of Stuttgart Ballet and return to Korea because of his sense of duty to transfer his experience on the world's best stages to his juniors in the homeland.
As the head of the National Ballet, director Kang is most concerned about "ballet popularization" and "activating creative ballet by training choreographers".
Finding a talented choreographer to increase the creation of the National Ballet's creative ballet is another wish that Director Kang wants to complete during his tenure.
Director Kang's decision to take off her shoes and open the second act of life as an arts administrator was also difficult to make without a challenging spirit full of guts.
Earlier last year, petroleum futures marked in the Chinese yuan were released in Shanghai.
There is one unforgettable event in the European financial world.
This is why China wants to access global bond market indicators and stock market indexes.
The structural change in China's population structure also affects the dollar.
Jean-Claude Juncker, EU Executive Committee Chairman, pointed out last September's term during his term, "How ridiculous it is for European companies to buy European planes and pay in dollars instead of euros."
The Chinese government needs to increase foreign demand for RMB-denominated assets to prevent foreign debt from building up.
At that time, the West German government also implemented American military aid programs.
Gold bought by central banks around the world last year was the highest since Richard Nixon broke the dollar-gold link in 1971.
In particular, Kim Ji-hyeon (28), Kim Ji-hyeon 2 (28), Oh Ji-hyeon (23), and Lee Ji-hyeon (23) lifted the KLPGA Tour trophy for consecutive 5 weeks from late May.
"He should, too, as he won the Doosan Match Play Championship, which ended two days before the interview, after a year and a month."
At that time, Kim Ji-hyun, who enjoyed her first win in 125 KLPGA tour events, even cried out amid a stream of congratulations.
It is said that he has become stronger because he has passed through all sorts of hardships.
Choi Hye-jin has been seen on the field when she graduated from elementary school.
"I did well until the third round last year, but I slowed down a bit on the last day and came in the 10th place," Kim Jihyun said. "This year, I will compete in the championships with a different attitude."
Kim Jihyun said, "Both players are playing golf steadily as well as playing with a simple and compact swing that I like."
It was also a cloned human being, which I often thought about when I was dealing with animals.
Not long ago, a sports newspaper in Spain reported that scientists claimed that FC Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi could be replicated with current technology.
I am not saying that such a situation is inevitable.
In order to answer that, let's go back to the days when it was no wonder that humans treated other humans like livestock and we didn't believe everyone's life was equal.
What I want to say is that if there is a possibility of exploiting the weak and gaining great benefits, we will not worry about them and give up the possibility.
I have worked in poultry farms, pig farms, etc. over the past few years and have written about how and in what circumstances food animals are raised in our society.
This novel is set in a society where human cloning technology is commercialized.
One of the most thoroughly explored novels is “Do not send me” by Nobel laureate Kazuo Ishiguro last year.
In addition to the phone reports, prosecutors have reportedly secured several evidence showing that Lee was deeply involved in Samsung's management issues.
It means that the company can exercise its right to buy half of its shares (50%-1 shares) in Samsung Peace before its corporate value rises due to the listing on the Nasdaq.
Just as his father, Chairman Lee Kun-hee, succeeded in the semiconductor business, Vice chairman Lee tries to establish himself as the top three general manager through the bio business.
Samsung has argued that it was impossible to assess the call option held by Biogen before 2015, and that Samsung Bioepis's listing on the Nasdaq was not pursued before 2015.
This was revealed when the prosecution recently recovered more than 2,100 computer files that Samsung Bioepis deleted when prosecution charge was expected last year July.
Although the company's business connection is less relevant when Samsung Bio was established, but it is why Vice Chairman Lee made it a subsidiary of Cheil Industries, where he holds a large stake.
Last year, Samsung deleted all of the recordings of Vice chairman Lee's conversation and reports with details of the conversation, but the prosecution recently recovered much of it.
In particular, the prosecution is paying attention to the fact that Samsung covered up the previously reported facts to the group's chief executive officer, Lee, and has made other claims externally.
Financial authorities concluded last year that Samsung Bio had deliberately made accounting fraud worth KRW 4.5 trillion, and the prosecution is in a situation where it is meditating on Samsung Electronics' business support TF, which has supported Vice Chairnman Lee's control of the group.
The folder titled "Vice-Chairman's Phone-call Result" and "A Countermeasure related to BioGen Company's proposal (reported to vice chairman)" reportedly contained voice recordings, phone conversation recordings, and organized files of calls with Vice-Chairman Lee.
There are concerns that we may miss the so-called "golden time" at a time when global CMO-specialized companies are striving to expand their production plants daily to achieve economies of scale.
It is predicted that major strategies such as winning global orders and building a fourth plant would inevitably be disrupted following the drop in global credibility.
While working as an executive director of Samsung Total's planning, President Kim joined the task force (TF) for the new business, which was set up by Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-hee in 2007 and took the role of a midwife of the establishment of Samsung BioLogics.
As the prosecution continued its investigation, president Kim recently decided not to attend the world's largest bio exhibition "Bio USA" in Philadelphia next month.
The fact that President Kim has served as the de facto head of Samsung's Bio business also darkens the future of Samsung BioLogics.
If President Kim's management gap is prolonged, it is expected that Samsung will inevitably face setbacks in Samsung's core strategies such as the construction of a fourth plant.
Last year, Chinese companies that went into "dollar debts" due to the continused U.S. interest rate hike were burdened with costs, but this year they are benefiting from the trade war.
As the expiration approaches,Chinese companies are helping to cut costs as President Donald Trump is putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.
As of April this year, Chinese companies issued 290 cases of dollar bonds, totaling USD 38.2 billion, according to Bloomberg data.
Chinese companies that issued dollar bonds are shouting "joyful screams" amid keen attention on whether the U.S. will cut its key interest rate amid the intensifying U.S.-China trade war.
The biggest reason why Chinese companies issue large amounts of dollar bonds is that most of the dollar bonds issued a few years ago come due.
"Actually, when you visit the local prominent companies, you have good working conditions and good welfare," he said. "But the young go there no matte what."
That's the role of a proper opposition to change the lives of young people.
It is the contents where the representative Hwang has always insisted on the public welfare Campaign.
Looking at what he said as "Local small and medium-sized companies are not receiving attention because young people are trying to go to large companies or become civil servants," blaming young people, we are sure he doesn't have perception of national responsibility.
Young people prepare for civil service exams and prepare for employment to enter large corporations because of their unstable future and long-term labor and low wages prevalent in Korean society.
If the amendment is passed, the game company should process the complaint as quickly as possible about the damage suffered by the user due to a game error such as a bug, a discrepancy in probability, a non-payment of compensation, and connection failures.
An amendment is in the process of requiring the game company to immediately handle complaints about the problem if the user has experienced loss due to the game error.
If the bill passes the National Assembly, it will be enforced after the six-month preparation period.
The problem is when the user is harmed by a game error.
Until now, even if a user complains about a problem, the game company has responded silently or passively, which led to building distrust among users.
However, if too many ovarian follicles grow, the possibility of complications called Ovarian Hyperstimuation Syndrome with increase in abdominal ascites or difficulty in breathing may arise, so the number of ovarian follicles growing should be adjusted accordingly.
Methods for inducing superovulation include natural cycle therapy, hypoallergenic therapy, short-term therapy, and long-term therapy, but short-term therapy and long-term therapy are the most commonly used methods.
"Men perform a test tube baby procedure if sperm conditions are very poor," said Lee Eung-seok, director of Subfertility Clinic at Hoe Yu-jae Hospital in Ilsan, a hospital specializing in obstetrics and gynecology.
The standard of this surgery is when both fallopian tubes of women are blocked, and it is difficult to expect pregnancy by treatment other than external fertilization surgery.
Manager Lee explained, “Short-term therapy is especially preferred because of the short duration of period of receiving injections and the low probability of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome compared to long term."
Coincidentally, the term "Law of Moon" is gaining popularity as Modi and Jokowi, both of whom are close to President Moon, are successfully re-elected.
As foreign leaders who are close to President Moon Jae-in succeeded in re-elections, the term "Law of Moon" is on everybody's lips.
In a telephone conversation, President Moon told President Jokowi that the lives of Indonesian people will continue to be happier and richer with his folksy and inclusive leadership.
President Moon wrote on his Facebook page on the 24th congratulating Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his victory and succession, saying, "I would like to congratulate Prime Minister Modi who won the election in about a month."
President Moon also made a state visit to Indonesia in November 2017 and delivered a video message from popular idol group Shinee member, Minho, and a signed CD of EXO as wedding gifts for President Jokowi's eldest daughter.
"President Moon delivered a congratulatory message to Prime Minister Modi for winning the general elections of India in the form of an official diplomatic document," Cheong Wa Dae explained.
During his state visit to India in July last year, President Moon was hospitably welcomed by Prime Minister Modi who spent more than half of his schedule with Moon.
The friendship with India will be a great opportunity for us as well, he said. "India will grow into a prosperous country with Prime Minister Modi in Asia," he added.
In his book, "The Handbook of the Dictator," he stresses politicians to concentrate on rallying the minimum number of supporters, which is necessary to win and maintain power, instead of universal support.
So is the increase in the number of commercial workers while the improving quality of employment is also cited.
There is an ominous feeling that the Korean economy is becoming structurally deteriorating.
Restaurants and pubs are putting more and more "Thank You", the words for closing business, the industrial complex is becoming vacant, and it is becoming more difficult to see people in the market.
Despite opposition from his/her supporters, his/her re-evaluation of the free trade agreement between Korea and the U.S. for the sake of the entire nation and the future is taking place.
Statistics quoted by Cheong Wa Dae to refute economic deterioration and show that income-driven growth are working are either "semi-true" or, in a bad way, "semi-false".
This trend has not changed particularly not only last year and also this year, so it is meaningless to argue that the increase in regular jobs is evidence of a higher quality of employment.
The same is true of the reality in which citizens watch, hear, wrestle with them.
The growing fervor for former president Roh's memory is by no means just due to his special relationship with the government.
The potential growth rate consists of three: labor, capital input and total element productivity. All of these three elements are likely to have fallen significantly in the current administration.
In particular, police have not ruled out the possibility that the metal release machine may have affected the explosion, as the victims were preparing for a "release operation" of removing cores from the inside of the propellant at the time.
An analysis result showed that the main cause of the accident at Hanwha's Daejeon plant, which killed three people in the explosion, was due to an electrostatic factor.
The explosion occurred when static electricity, which had been piled inside the propellant without being discharged, created a spark while moving to the pointed lower part of the core.
According to the Daejeon Provincial Police Agency on the 24th, the explosion occurred due to the spark of static electricity accumulated inside the propulsion body.
It was investigated that the opinion, "The core and the center did not match, leading to make it crash left and right, and react with residual chemicals," which was raised in the risk factor excavation report earlier was not the cause of the explosion.
If you save money into a Kkoomnarae bank account for three or five years, you can receive an additional reserve fund for your own savings, which will double for those who receive living or medical benefits, and 1.5 times for non-beneficiaries and housing and education benefit recipients.
Hwang Chi-young, the head of Seoul Welfare Policy said, “I hope the young people and the citizens who dream of future and save their money despite the difficult environments will have a happy future based on the smooth property formation."
Residents aged 18 to 34 who live in Seoul, whose income is below 2.2 million won per month, and whose parent and spouse income are below 80% of the median income (3.69 million won for four households).
Seoul City plans to implement interest-free loans in cooperation with the corporate "People Who Live together," in order to prevent those stop depositing and close their bank account due to their financial situation.
The Seoul City's 'Hope Double Youth Bankbook' is a bank account whose young owner double what you saved for two to three years, if you faithfully save.
Indeed, the most preferred way for many companies to enter North America, still, is to connect with large retailers that can deliver large quantities at low prices.
If you raise the awareness of the product through marketing and get the attention and satisfaction of consumers, it becomes the value of the product and the brand.
There are many similar products in the world, but the price and sales are determined by the brand's value, so big companies will be in touch first.
It seems that it would be nice to think first about what is first.
It should be thought about wether to sell first and foremost or to build brand awareness in the long run and to erode market share and increase long-term sales through ongoing customer management.
It would be great to meet here for the first time, established relationships, and built trust, but it is very rare for a container-sized transaction to take place from the beginning.
In fact, when counseling, I found that quite a few companies have already made many attempts to enter North America, and most have failed.
All of this is due to the lack of information about the new market.
Even if they are lucky enough to connect with large businesses, the problem is how they approach them.
The Supreme Court's second division (Supreme Court Justice Noh Jeong-hui) said on the 24th that the former taxi driver, identified only by his surname Lee, has confirmed the original ruling that he lost the plaintiff in an appeal for cancellation of a private taxi transportation business license filed against the Gyeyang-gu Office in Incheon.
It became controversial because it was not clear whether the administrative office could revoke the license only during the suspended period, or at any time regardless of the period of suspension.
He filed a lawsuit against the Gyeyang-gu Office for revocation of his license, saying it was unfair to have his license revoked after his probation period ended, based on a part of the law that says "a person who is on the period of suspension of execution".
A Supreme Court ruling was issued that the district office could revoke the license after a probationary period for a taxi driver who committed sexual offenses such as rape.
In the trial, the issue was on whether a taxi driver who had been sentenced to probation for a sexual offense could be forced to revoke a license after the probation period.
In September 2017, about a year after Lee's probation period, the Gyeyang-gu District Office in Incheon revoked Lee's qualifications for private taxis under the Passenger Transport Service Act.
They cut out the problematic part of colon through laparoscopic surgery, etc.
Having banana and persimmon that have rich tannin and drinking a daily 400cc or more of milk that has rich calcium can also worsen constipation.
Some of the childhood constipation is caused by congenital megalomania, which has no sympathetic nerve cells that governs the minister's movement.
I was better off on my prescription medication, but if I did not take it, my symptoms recurred.
It should also be questioned if child constipation lasts for more than several months.
It will also be good to re-employ after children enter college.
In addition to the real estate brokerage business, this field will become more active in the future, including real estate development or management, sales, auction, and investment consulting.
Unlike in the past, real estate has become academically organized, and there is a real estate department in college, and the Real Estate Advancement Act has made it more accessible for authorized brokers to advance to various fields.
The vacancy is bigger than I thought because housework of the housewives doesn't show even if it's good, but it is repeated everyday.

Lotte Shopping and E-Mart, which have a high proportion of rents, saw their lease debt increase by 6.6 trillion won and 1.5 trillion won, respectively, in the first quarter of this year from the end of last year.
Looking at the year-on-year trend, profitability has declined, excluding some industries (cars, cosmetics, hotels, and pharmaceuticals).
"In the case of distribution companies, the lower the proportion of their own stores, the higher their debt ratio is. And the higher the proportion of the operating lease flights of an airlines company, the bigger the width of the rise on debt ratio is," said Kim Min-jeong, a researcher at Hanwha Investment & Securities.
The companies saw their debt ratios jump from the first quarter of this year.
This is largely due to the decrease in global trade related to the US-China trade dispute and the decrease in Korean exports.
Shipers who borrow ships in the form of leases also affected changes in accounting standards.
However, controversy over "the exceptional clause" is expected to continue as the government is considering "exceptionally" allowing the abuse even if they remove the right to discipline and prohibit abuse "in principle."
In 2011, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child urged "to implement the National Human Rights Commission's recommendation to amend relevant laws and regulations to explicitly prohibit corporal punishment at home, at school and at all institutions."
In February 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that the punishment had not been achieved within the 'necessary range' in relation to the case in which a biological parent said that they would "kill" his son by acting like hitting with a baseball bat.
According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare's survey of 1,000 adults aged 20 or older nationwide from December 4 to 8, 2017, 68.3% of the respondents said the so-called "rod of love" is needed "depending on the situation."
The government is also promoting the introduction of a 'birth notification system', which allows medical institutions to notify national agencies of the birth of all children, and the introduction of a 'protective birth system', which allows the birth notification to be made without revealing the mother's personal information.
It was only natural that interest was amplified in the background of such a decision.
It was also true when he took office as president of Samsung Electronics, and began to be in front of management as a vice chairman of Samsung Electronics.
If the "choice and focus" implied the changes in the Lee Jae-yong era, the sale of Samsung Life Insurance's headquarters building in 2016 was a symbolic sign of the new start for the Lee Jae-yong regime.
It is said that it was because of his/her grandfather's advice that "management is enough to study in abroad, but to be a manager who understands human beings and culture, you need to study the humanities."
As soon as he failed to do business, there was controversy over his return to business.
In fact, even during the one-year period when Vice President Lee Jae-yong was imprisoned, there were no significant negative aspects in Samsung's performance or stock prices.
Since the Lee Jae-yong system went into full swing, Samsung has faced unexpected difficulties.
Now, son Lee Jae-yong, vice chairman, is standing in the position of Chairman Lee Kun-hee.
Even at a glance, it presented a goal that could not be realized objectively.
At that time, there were a lot of theories about the Big Deal.
Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong's failure was an issue that was enough for gossipers to notice.
It is no exaggeration to say that there are virtually no enemies in Korea.
In the distance, huge rocks on the mountain begin to catch eyes.
A magnificent view unfolds from the rocky cliff, rocks, and beautiful old pine trees altogether.
A full-fledged mountaineering begins when you take the left-side track of Dongan Temple.
It is an unexplored region that the rock formations, rock walls, and old pine trees go well with the waterfall.
Mureung Rock spreads out along the Yongorum Road from the waterfall to the beginning of Samhwa-dong.
A huge wall of rock across the cliff unfolds like a folding screen.
When you reach the summit, you will find holes in a wide rock like a yard.
The surrounding area of the rock is as fresh as if it had been sprinkled with light-green colored paint.
The essay class is closely managed by each university by five lecturers, including classes, correction, task management and consulting.
The strength of Seongbuk Jongno Academy's high school department is that it is effective to manage classes by taking classes in major courses in one seat that students lack.
The instructors who take part in the class are those who have built up know-how in college entrance exams for more than a decade in the second-round class, and can provide the possible customized guidance in school grades and the CSAT.
In the middle of the semester, there is intensive guidance for midterms and final exams centered on each subject class. Besides, they are actively supporting classes aimed at solving problems tailored to the trends of the CSAT and achieving the lowest academic ability in the CSAT.
This is because Jongno School's unique systematic curriculum and teaching ability have been a strong point.
In particular, high school students will be provided with systematic study programs that include 55 years of the Jongno Academy's traditional college entrance know-how as well as classes to prepare for application based on school records, consulting for entrance exams, immersion education during vacations, and counseling for customized career paths.
Recognize that different people enjoy different cultural lives, but must check and evaluate whether it is in accordance with God's statutes and laws.
The division of language into the Tower of Babel brought alienation among human beings.
As revealed in the word of God's covenant, God who gave the word of promise is the personage who never changes in accomplishing it.
As seen in the Tower of Babel, mankind was scattered by the judgments of God that resulted from the pride of their own exaltation and the ignorance of their disapproval of God.
Historically, so did Hitler's Nazism, and so did Japanese imperialism.
The problem is that fallen humans have interpreted and distorted God's beautiful "Mosaic" from their point of view of cultural diversity created by God.
The vicious cycle of being trapped in stereotyped self-centered thinking is repeated.
The dictionary meaning of the old man is old, but it has a stong negative meaning.
The ubervisors don't really know that they are ubervisors.
It is time for the the Democratic Party of Korea to ponder whether it is a party that is properly carrying out the reforms that the former President Noh had hoped for.
President Moon Jae-in recalled, “The name Noh Mu-hyeon is a symbol of a world free from foulness and privilege, a world in which common sense and principles work."
It is also in contrast to the National Statistical Office survey, which shows that the average age of the nation's population is 42 years old.
I hope the church will be a sanctuary full of pleasant laughter.
That's the real model of heaven we hope so much.
The world of creation, which God dreamed of, was the eternal festival of the Sabbath, the playground of Eden, which was naked with God and nature, but not ashamed and unsightly.
Beyond thinking human "Homo Sapiens" and instrumental human "Homo Faber", more fundamental human nature comes from play.
Hawuijinga says the most important factor in the nature of play is spontaneity.
At that time, Gangnam Life Art Club, including Rainbow Acoustic Guitar, Gangnam Model Line, Ensemble June, La Stella, Non-ta, Seoul Okarina Choir, Gloove and 1945 Art Troupe, have participated and performed a great performance.

Local governments should arrange labor force to make this task possible.
In 2000, the U.K. set up a government-level fact-finding committee to examine the problems and reflect them in its laws and systems after Victoria Klimby died of abuse at the age of 9.
The reason for the method of a complete enumeration targeting infants was that it was pointed out to be difficult to identify the risk factors as infants often stay within the family than children who are older.
However, if the government only introduces the birth notification system, there could be side effects such as mothers avoiding giving birth to medical institutions, so it will also introduce a protective birth control system as well.

While they understand the need to embrace the underprivileged, the industry believes that it is worrisome that innovation becomes stagnant due to this.
In a similar vein, Lee said, "The best way is for the government to take the initiative in helping traditional industries, and then for the innovative industries to take a lot of taxes, regulate them or split them up."
The difference in values between the government, which puts more weight on the Balance between innovation and tolerance, and the industry, which has to speed up to secure competitiveness, has been reconfirmed.

The main focus of the the Provisional Assembly expansion is to expand the conditions of member selections, which had been restricted as Korean living in Jung Kyung to living in Hwabuk, Manchuria, the Soviet Union, and the Americas, and it was the continuous demand from the left wing.

For special rape, where a weapon is used or 2 or more people work together, there is a statute of limitation of 15 years, only for crimes committed after December 21st, 2007, when the revision of the code of criminal procedure was put into effect.
The prosecution applied the charges of the alleged sexual assault on both the former Vice Minister Kim and Yoon with the arrest warrant, and as the court judged that much of the charges were cleared it might work adversely on the former Vice Minister Kim.
Yoon Jung-cheon, a construction developer suspected of offering bribes and sexual favors to the former Vice Minister of Justice Kim Hak-ui, is leaving the court after attending a court hearing at the Seoul Central District Court in the afternoon of the 22nd.
"Many of the crimes have been cleared of suspicion," senior judge Myeong Jae-gwon explained the reason for issuing by saying, "the case is important and there is a possibility of destruction of evidence."
However, since no circumstantial evidence has been detected that the former Vice Minister Kim used violence and blackmail, it is not likely that it will be easy to prove sex crimes.
In particular, it is noteworthy that the prosecution has gone beyond the issue of statute of limitations, which has been the biggest obstacle to the investigation, by applying rape charges.

One of the main variables of the global economy is the U.S. economy, especially its interest rates.

Currently, the price of school uniforms of 99 out of 256, that is 30 percent, of middle and high schools that support free school uniforms, in Incheon are more expensive than the subsidy.
Now, there is a difference in uniform prices because it is the "Lowest Price Bidding System" where the company with the lowest price among companies that passed the quality screening after bidding each school becomes the successful bid.
Regarding the issue of some school uniforms exceeding the subsidy for free uniforms, it is planned that the price of school uniforms will be analyzed and the appropriate amount of support will be reviewed along with the city government.
The survey was carried out at the plenary session of the Incheon City Council last March when the "clearing out stock" problem surfaced that some schools received school uniforms that were manufactured four to five years ago.
It will also push for a plan to require school uniform suppliers to issue a pledge to the effect that they "will risk sanctions if they fail to abide by their contracts and become a fraudulent company."
At the time, it was pointed out that parents were required to pay extra for the difference while the free school uniform support fund was set at KRW 266,000 per person by the city office of education.
There are dozens of schools that complained that the company did not exchange the size or did not list the date of manufacture on the clothing label.
This is a significant increase compared to the fact that 14 schools were supplied the inventory, according to the survey conducted in March and April of this year.
In the process of supporting free school uniforms for middle and high school freshmen, which were first implemented in Incheon this year, "inventory sold in remainder" and "delivery delay" were found to be serious.

In the morning at the Bank Hall in Myeong-dong, Seoul, Chairman Choi, who held a ceremony for 'Youth Rent-to-Money Loan Agreement', criticized Socar CEO Lee Jae-woong during the Q & A process with reporters.
Lee's response is read as a circumvented criticism that Choi, who has been running for the general election since the beginning of the election, has started a so-called 'noise marketing' that attracts the public's attention through problematic remarks.
In fact, CEO of Poolus Seo Yeong-u has commented on the post of CEO Lee that day, saying, "They say there is a rumor of (chairman Choi's) running in Gangwon-do in next year's general elections."
Another representative of the Korea Democratic Party also said that "chairman Choi, who graduated from Gangneung High School with the surname Choi based in Gangneung, will have considerable competitiveness if he runs with a ministerial-level background," and that 'there will be no major opposition within the party, only if he accepts."
Vice chairman Kim, a native of Muan, Jeollanam-do, is known to be an alumni of Daedong High School in Gwangju along with Kang Gi-jeong, chief presidential secretary for political affairs, and Song Yeong-gil, representative of the Democratic Party of Korea, and has a lot to do with people in the ruling camp.
Kim is certain to quit during the upcoming vice minister-level appointments, and it is known that he recently visited the National Assembly and reportedly offered his resignation goodbyes centered on the the State Affairs Committee.
It is classified as a strong candidate in the midst of the emergence of senior officials such as Moon Jae-in's ministerial deputy in the ruling parties to win the next general election.
Some evaluated that on the court's issuance of an arrest warrant for Yoon on the 22nd, the prosecution's application of the charge of rape and injury and submission of a number of evidence to prove it had a decisive impact.
If the prosecution secured the photo through a thorough confiscation in 2013, they could also review the application of injury due to rape charges and of even the charge of special rape, whose statute of limitations was terminated now, at the time.
The prosecution, which investigated allegations related to previous vice-minister Kim in 2013 and 2014, did not investigate Kim's bribery, and has dismissed all of Kim's allegations of sex crimes.
There are rising voices calling for making a close inquiry into the allegation of the poor investigation conducted by the prosecution in the past, as former Vice Minister of the Department of Justice Kim Hak-ui was arrested on charges of bribes and as contractor Yoon Joong-cheon was arrested on charges of rape and injury which is a sex crime, respectively.
"In the process of investigating allegations of authority abuse of Office of Senior Presidential Secretary for Civil Affairs in ‘the Blue House of Park Geun-hye’, 'overlooking investigation' of the past prosecution may be revealed," a prosecution official said.
In an interview with the Internet media on the 21st, Lim Chang-yong detailed the disagreements between himself and manager Kim and the situation inside the team.
However, Lim Chang-yong's claim that "the team informed him of the release" is convincing, given that manager Kim placed importance on hierarchy and Lim Chang-yong at that time was opposed to manager Kim's management of the pitcher.
After manager Kim Ki-tae's resignation, KIA Tigers, who are running along the winning road, met a reef called "Im Chang-Yong's disclosure".
When there was a protest from fans after Im Chang-yong was released last year, head coach Kim used to explain that "Im wanted to go out on his own."
After the resignation of director Kim, the team batting is up and down 3,000.
If racism occurs inside the stadium, the team can be fined a significant amount or forfeited from the games.

"The London Security Court has issued a fine of 184 pounds for a middle-aged man who made racist remarks to Son Heung-min," the Guardian said on the 23rd (Korean time).
Son Heung-min heard racist comments as he was leaving the field after the Caravao Cup round of 16 against West Ham United in October last year.
The court also dismissed the football ban, which Tottenham called for, saying, “It is too much to ban a man admitted to a football field.”
A fine of £184 (about 270,000 won) was fined for the man who made a racist remark to Son Heung-min (27), who plays in Tottenham Hotspur of the English professional football Premier League (EPL).
A very interesting comment in this regard came in a speech to the British Parliament on April 23 by Greta Thunberg, a teenage Swedish girl.
Whether in the U.S., South Korea, or elsewhere, intense discussions are urgent to change the nation's decision-making system fundamentally.
Now is the time for more drastic political decisions than ever before.
Denuclearization is also meaningful only when it pursues denuclearization under the proposition of greening the Korean Peninsula.
Korea is not the only country to go through that politics itself is the most troublesome issue, which is far from politics, being the key to solving the problem.
The heat, which arrived a month earlier than usual, has been here since May. But contrary to concerns, it will be a less hot summer than last year.

The building, created for the purpose of better understanding each other between South Korea and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), was completed two years ago by Samhan General Construction Co., Ltd.
The chairman (Kim Hee-geun), who heard when and how the accident happened and the sad story, ran to the scene and met the survivors. A few days later, he gave 10 million won as a way to express his consolation at the deceased's home.
Even moving to a construction site can be tricky due to a lot of procedural problems.
As a construction company, it is important to be responsible for customer satisfaction even after completion.
In fact, according to the results, it has been counted that a total of 20 chemical-related accidents have occurred in the Daesan Industrial Complex in the past three years, including 3 in 2017, 10 last year and 7 this year.
In the wake of a series of chemical-related accidents in the Daesan industrial complex, calls are mounting for a complete review of such things as safety and control measures for chemicals in the industrial complex.
Although the amount of ammonia detected was below standard level, not enough to affect the environment and health, residents in the neighborhood are suffering from major unrest due to a series of news related to the chemical.
According to the Seosan City, Chungnam Fire Department, and the Seosan Chemical Disaster Prevention Center on the 22nd, amalgamated gas was detected at Daehan-eup Green Chemicals, Seosan City at 10:42 am.
A trace amount of ammonia leaked from the green chemical plant next door just five days after the oil vapour leak occurred at Hanwha Total's Daesan plant in Seosan, South Chungcheong Province.
The painting engraved on the logo showed a granddaughter, who is so big, carrying former president Roh in the back seat of her bicycle as opposed to the photo we knew.
In particular, Roh's running in the field of Bongha with Suheun behind his bicycle is famous for those who remember his human aspect.
At the time when bereaved family members and other figures, including the first lady Kwon Yang-sook, from the participatory government bowed, Miss Seo-un displayed her finger "V" toward former president Roh's portrait and numerous cameras.
At the memorial service of the 10th anniversary of the death of former President Roh Moo-hyun, Miss Roh Seo-un, whose arm was folded with that of former U.S. President George W. Bush, was spotted.

At a glance, it contained all the typical characteristics of money laundering methods.
It is an argument that prosecutors have been pushing for an investigation into the allegation that the wounds on the deceased's body were caused by the deceased's sister, Kim's wife, not by CEO Bang's family.
My sister-in-law went to the lawyers to get a divorce, but everyone refused.
A few months before the suicide, the former husband and children accused her (Lee Mi-ran) of withdrawing money, she informed the children of such a fact (a huge amount of money in the handling of the aftermath of the accident).
The children continued to say, 'Mom should be gone', 'you should go out and die,' and it is shown in the deathnote as a suicide motive.
The incredible words and actions of the Representative Bang and children, claimed by the deceased's own family members and neighbors, inevitably invite the question of "why."
Smart people worked hard to create amazing legal creations.
I first learned about it through my wife when my sister-in-law complained about it about three months before my death.
Viewers were surprised to see the late Lee Mi-ran's last voice, desperate comments from her own family, unconvincing investigations by prosecutors and police, and CEO Bang's coercive attitude toward the "PD Notebook."
Kim Hak-ryeol, a former deputy prime minister for economic affairs under former President Park Jeong-hui, is his father.
I think a one percent increase in the number of people who think they should be punished for their crimes will break that belief.
At the time of the proposal of marriage, the marriage was actively recommended that the Chosun Ilbo family members do not meet the wind wave because they do not have authority but are friendly and humble.
The part of that money was used to sort out children's troubles.
In January this year, the Fair Trade Commission raised the company's capital to 1.5 billion won from 300 million won as the moral hazard of the funeral service agencies was serious and businesses were forced to close without paying consumers' advance payments.
Pastor Ko Myung-jin's short, deep message of the gospel was so touching that many people on the scene wept under the grace given by the Lord in the first snow.
There are too many correct funeral terms for Christians to use.
Sometimes, the church is organizing, but at the request of the children, there are other religious rites sometimes, which cannot be tolerated.
Since the broadcast, many pastors of both large and small churches, have been told that their church will change its term to Rehabilitation Service, rather than Executive Service.
I once planned a resurrection long-awaited worship service (Graveside Service), when the funeral of late former President Kim Young-sam was conducted as a state funeral on November 22, 2015.
I can't say everything about each term, but I'd like to find out about the words that must be changed.
The center often forces nursing care workers to work less than 15 hours a week.
In particular, there is a big reason for the pay dissatisfaction and dismissal concerns.
Ha Mi-jeong (55, false name), a visiting care provider in Gwangju, said, "There are many cases in which heads of care centers hire those who they know, family members, relatives, and others as care providers, pay them more in the name of such things as extra pay, and get it back."

The world is not so naive as to judge whether the activities of the Yejang-dong Church's Intervention " (Heresy) Damage Investigation Research Committee" are aimed at protecting the saints from real heresy, or to exclude and brand those who do not suit their taste.
It is questionable who would recognize the authority of heresy from the outside as well as from within Christianity, given that the decision was made and released as necessary.
Even as a politician, I don't have to think about what kind of people support me.
It is said that a comedy-like situation was created in which the applicant was asked about what the problem was, without properly figuring out what the problem was.
These days, politicians are seen crossing the line every day.
Graduated from Seoul national university law school, as a judge, as a four-line congressman, and slang words that contain the sexual meaning of women politicians who have taken the elite course, it is hard how to understand.
What is more worrisome is that no matter how much the Korean church yells at him as heresy, there is a situation in which the world does not recognize its authority.
I just lose my words in the situation that the word that penetrates people's minds with ideological division becomes the everyday words in political world.
If the word Red had a history of killing hundreds of people, in the history of Christianity in 2000, the word "Heresy" dominated many people's lives.
So it doesn't matter if what they say is true or not.
If those who respond to the words "Pro-North Korea Left" and "Red" are on my side, there is no reason to be cautious.
The joint group of the Presbyterian Church of Korea, one of the largest in Korea, recently conducted an investigation, saying that the head of various missionary groups and the publishing company specializing in theology may be heresy.
This problem why this occurs is because supply is far less than demand.
The failure to meet the supply is due to different views between taxi companies, drivers and service providers over the transition to full pay.
First of all, it is hard to arrange a taxi regardless of the time zone.
Labor and management continue to consult in the process of the payment system transition.
When that process is completed, supply is likely to increase.
I kept calling over 30 minutes in busy areas with many passersby around City Hall or Yeouido, but I couldn't get a Weigo taxi.
Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong met with former US President George W. Bush, who was visiting to attend the late Roh Moo-hyun's 10th Anniversary of Memorial Ceremony, and discuss global issues.
Vice Chairman Lee's recent series of meetings with top foreign officials is seen as a management move to devise future food businesses for Samsung Electronics.
During the meeting, Vice Chairman Lee reportedly asked former President Bush for advice on the role of companies in the rapidly changing global industrial environment, while introducing future business directions that Samsung Electronics is pushing for.
The meeting between the two came four years after Bush exchanged pleasantries when he visited Seoul in October 2015 to attend the opening ceremony of the Presidents Cup golf tournament.

"But they need to stand up to the characteristics of those generations because they are more straightforward than their predecessors," he laughed.
He especially emphasizes "stronger sermons", as the preacher does not have any particular intention and identifies the Bible author's intentions and delivers a message from the Bible text.
The sermon, declared on the foundation of reformism in the classical form of worship, not only lasts more than an hour on average, but also has high difficulty.
Talking about how much his monthly salary is and why he failed to get promoted, he said, God makes me realize that he is a man who wonders about the daily life of the saints.
"The hardest thing before being a pastor was when the preacher didn't know why he had read the text of the Bible." he said.
Starting with the 'Galatians' integrated Bible study series in 2014, 'For you to be at work overtime', 'Can you love repentance', and 'New family session' attracted attention.

The general evaluation is that inter-Korean relations, which were frozen in the Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations, have been greatly improved in the Moon Jae-in administration, and a window for dialogue for peace on the Korean peninsula is generally estimated.
Choi Chang-ryul, Yong In University professor, said, "North and US negotiating denuclearization and sanctions on North Korea make it more difficult to solve the North Korean nuclear issue than in the Roh Moo-hyun administration."

The academic department's direction of support is to carry out various activities in connection with the curriculum so that students can develop basic skills for their majors while developing their competencies in areas of interest.
There are differences in the curriculum which each school offered, Han Dae-bu High School(Hanyang University High School) has broadened its options to allow students to choose from a variety of subjects.
The questions and curiosity of the class are expanded, leading to the preparation of reports within the school hours, and also to the exploration subject of various school activities, which are further developed into the following school curriculum, academic self-regulation club, consumptive activity, and reading activities.

Kim Young-jin contacted pro-Korea congresswoman Tony Hall, President of the U.S. Breakfast Prayer Meeting, and eventually held the Assembly Hall Prayer Meeting of about 50 people, including such official retinue as Kim Jin-pyo, the Finance and Economy Minister, and as Yoon Young-kwan, Foreign Minister, and U.S. senators and congresswomen.
Kim Young-jin, a devout Protestant elder and head of the State Breakfast Prayer Meeting, was embarrassed, but prayed, thinking that there would be something to help promote friendly relations between the two countries.
It was to find a way to smooth the first meeting between the two leaders, who are very different in character through holding a breakfast meeting between the two countries to wish for the success of the summit and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
It was the first time since the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry was established to become an official entourage in the visit to the U.S. of the president.
Kim Young-jin said that two things came to mind during the preparation process.
The official record of his visit here was the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of a happy city on July 20, 2007, the last year of his term in office, in front of Eojin Middle School where the event was held.
After the election, in April 2003, the Taskforce for the Construction of a New Administrative Capital began its activities, and in June a related bill was written and passed in the National Assembly at the end of the year.
He said, “It is very sad that Sejong City, which contains the former president Roh's dreams, becomes a city of civil servants and is only mentioned as a target for apartment or real estate investment."
In Sejong, “reservation sites” for the relocation of these institutions are already in place around the Prime Minister's official residence, located northeast of the Government Complex Sejong.
If Seoul and the metropolitan area continue to suck up money and resources and competent people like black holes, it will be hard to expect a balanced development of the country as mandated by the Constitution.
There hardly found footsteps of Roh in Sejong, but there are several other places related to him besides the lake park.
"It's a pity that the 'world lived by people' he was trying to create (even now, after 10 years) hasn't come yet." Kwak Jin-hwan (age 54) who took a picture of the symbol at Sejong Lake Park said on the afternoon of the 20th in Sejong Lake Park.
In his lifetime, Roh had high expectations for Sejong City.

It has been revealed in the prosecution's investigation that the factory floor was torn and important details were hidden beneath it, which the prosecution believes was directed by the top executives in the process of removing evidence.
The prosecution has requested arrest warrants for three people, Samsung Electronics CEO Kim Tae-han, vice president of Samsung Electronics Business Support TF Kim and Samsung Electronics Vice President Park.
The two vice presidents of Samsung Electronics, who were also charged with warrants, are top executives of Samsung Electronics Co.'s Baek and Seo, who were previously arrested.
Judging that Samsung Electronics' Business Support TF took the lead of the destruction of evidence, the prosecution plans to summon Chung Hyun-ho, the chief executive of Samsung Electronics' Business Support TF, as soon as the conviction of the vice presidents are determined.
Prosecutors believe Kim and others were ordered to destroy a series of evidence, including hiding company servers in the factory floor.
At the request of the Ministry of Employment and Labor, Professor Noh focused on the response of businesses that were heavily affected by the minimum wage from November last year to last month.
Professor Noh pointed out, "When determining the minimum wage level, it is necessary to take the economy as a whole, the conditions of vulnerable industries and small businesses, etc. into consideration."
"The food and lodging industries should not be overinterpreted that the minimum wage hike has resulted in a decrease in their employment, as it was also difficult 10 years ago and 20 years ago," said Kim Jong-jin, deputy director of the Korea Labor and Society Institute.
It is interpreted that the minimum wage hike has raised wages for low-wage workers.
The Ministry of Employment and Labor held a forum at the Press Center in Jung-gu, Seoul, on the 21st, analyzed and made a presentation of how the minimum wage hike worked on workers' wages and employment last year.
That's how much the wage gap between workers has been reduced.
In a conversation with KBS on the 9th, President Moon Jae-in said, "We do not have to be trapped in a pledge to raise the minimum wage to KRW 10,000 by next year."
Small and medium manufacturers in the industrial complex often chose to reduce working hours.

The prosecution secured a statement that after seeing this, the former chairman Lee ordered, "As lawmaker Kim is working so hard to assist us, KT, find out a way to help his daughter work here as a regular employee."
Reports said prosecutors have secured a statement that former KT Chairman Lee Suk-chae personally ordered the hiring of the daughter of Kim Sung-tae of the Liberty Korea Party as a regular worker.
It turned out that the decisive reason for ordering the recruitment was because Lawmaker Kim actively blocked Lee from adopting witnesses during the parliamentary audit.
Based on this, the prosecution is reportedly considering the application of bribery charges or third-party bribery charges regarding lawmaker Kim for illegal favors.
At that time, lawmaker Kim's daughter had already been unable to apply as the list of those who passed the document screening was announced, but under the former chairman Lee's orders, she entered the company as a regular employee after undergoing personality tests, which was supposed to be taken by only those who passed the document screening.

The idea of a "The little Ball Shot By A Dwarf Park" in the corner of the newly built Dunchon apartment is an idea that has come out of the heads of novelists who are quick to imagine but have almost zero momentum.
The names have become landmarks of the cities.
Most of all, the teacher's judgment that he must be reprimanded, let alone like these juniors' ideas, is another factor that made him hesitate to take concrete action.

Following his visit to rare earth-related companies and the departure site of Gen. Jang Dae-jung, Chinese President Xi Jinping has visited an Army infantry school and called for enhanced war capabilities, sending a message of defiance to the U.S. daily.
The New York Times reported that the United States is considering putting the High-tech Vision, the world's leader in the CCTV industry, on the Commerce Department's Technology Export Restriction List.
During an inspection tour of rare earth company Jinli Permanant Magnet Science and Technology in Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province, on the 20th, Mr. Xi said that the rare earths are important strategic and nonrenewable resources.
This remark seems to emphasize that China can use rare earth as a strategic card in the trade war with the United States.
The responsibility issue of Hwang Kyo-ahn, chairman of the Liberty Korea Party, who avoided disciplinary action against Reckless Remarks against May 18 has evaporated and disputes over "skipping handshakes" have surfaced at the forefront of the controversy.
A similar figure overlapped as the conservative members sang “Busan Seagull” in Geumnam-ro, Kwangju city on the 39th anniversary of the May 19th Democratic Movement.
Behind spectatorship impersonating the objective, there is hidden a malignant complot.
Former president Kim would not have tolerated at least the "absurd remarks about the Gwangju Democratization Movement," coming from lawmakers of his party, although he joined hands with former authoritarian forces through the merger of the three parties.
The story that leader has become political mentor of Representative Hwang later was written in media just like a beautiful story, but it is not a beautiful story, but just a side of cruel path according to dictatorship.
However, the U.S. authorities also shows avoiding making official comments as much as possible, apparently wary of hindering the ongoing denuclearization talks between Washington and Pyongyang.
The North Korean ambassador to the United Nations, Kim Sung, held a rare press conference at the United Nations headquarters on the 21st and demanded an immediate return of "Wise Honest", saying that the US government's act of seizing the North Korean cargo ship is "illegal and rude".
North Korea's open fight with the United States on the international stage is interpreted as an intention to evoke public opinion aimed at easing sanctions against North Korea, along with a strong stance against the seizure of cargo ships.
The Ministry of Justice announced on the 9th that North Korea seized Wise Honest for violating international sanctions, saying "it was used to illegally ship North Korea's coal and transport heavy equipment to North Korea."
The U.S. Ministry of Justice's seizure of North Korean ships is an unprecedented move, which is widely believed to be related to the North's missile launch that day.
Because it becomes sensitive to light and sound, the symptoms become more severe.
Regarding "cluster headache" that suddenly occurs during sleep, very severe pain occurs periodically at night for several weeks or months.
It usually appears a lot in menopause, and with pain in the back of the head and shoulders, the back of the neck feels stiff, and sometimes senses don't work well.
When migraine headaches start, a throbbing or tingling pain as if the heart is beating on the head tends to pop up, and in severe cases, it can lead to indigestion and vomiting.
Migraines and tension headaches can be helped by tender point injections along with medication, and botox and mesotherapy helps reduce the number and intensity of chronic migraines, engaging in restoring one's vital everyday life.
The occipital neuralgia also prioritizes the pain reliever or anticonvulsant first, and sometimes the pressure point injection on the muscles around it and the nerve block are necessary.
Most headaches are also effective as medication, but they may be injected depending on the severity of symptoms, and rarely, surgery may be needed.
Most headaches can be effective with painkillers that can be easily purchased at pharmacies, but if pain persists even after taking painkillers, it is needed to figure out the exact problem.
When a cluster headache is acute, high-concentration oxygen inhalation treatment is effective.
First, "migraine", which is only felt on one side of the head, occurs spasmodically and periodically due to vascular dysfunction in the head, and it is more common in women.
When it gets worse, the pain spreads to the side of the eye, and sometimes making the eye sight to dim.
According to statistics from the National Health Insurance Review and Assessment Bureau on the 22nd, the number of headache patients increased by 21% in five years from 758,302 in 2014 to 91,864 last year.
The pain continues for 15 to 90 minutes, with extreme pain that seems to cut out the inside of the eye and pain at the back of one eye or around the eye.
The "occipital neuralgia" is divided into greater occipital neuralgia, which causes pain in the middle of the back of the head and the back of the neck, and lesser occipital neuralgia, which causes pain in the middle of the back head and in the back of the ear and in the temple.
This is because it is difficult to take into account the social environment facing the disabled only with the disability rating system.
Kim Seong-hwan, Chief Secretary of the Democratic Party of Korea, who had heard the story of a group of blind people who had staged a protest, saying, "Stop abolishing the false rating system."
Kim said, "I've never met the CEO in this way. I don't know the content, so if you let me know, I'll go through the procedure."
On the 21st, at 8:30 am in front of the Democratic Party of Yeouido, Seoul, where the "Democracy's Road" ceremony was held, the blind and mothers held a demonstration to meet Lee Hae-chan, a representative of the Democratic Party.
Police, party officials, and protesters also clashed in the process.
He called the aide to bring his business cards.
As he said that "The chief of the disabled service department and his senior of the department know this," lawmaker Mr. Kim wrote down this carefully.
It is far from the topic of trying to moving away from the fast follower that follows the R&D trend in advanced countries and to solidify the basics and to be the first mover through original and leading research.
That is the basic science statistics that Minister Yoo mentioned at the Seoul Forum.
Researcher-led methods accounted for 25.1 to 23.3% of the basic research fund (Research Foundation statistics) from 2013 until 2017; however, the Moon Jae-in government greatly increased it.
"In our application of basic science and basic research, basic research includes basic science of universities and research institutes, engineering research that does not require short-term application, and discovery of medicine, medicine, medicine, agriculture, dentistry, and medicine," explained president Kuk Yang of the Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology.
First of all, when calculating the basuc research statistics based on the criteria,there is much room for arbitraryness to be involved by requiring the researcher in charge to writes basic research, applied research, and development research.
Without surprise, the deliberation for the minimum wage of this year began under the original structure because idle National Assembly did not even consider passing the revised legislative bill.
Although it has been ambitious enough to be interpreted as a part of the "speed adjustment of the minimum wage increase," even Lee Li-ja, a secretary of Liberty Korea Party of the National Environmental Labor Commission, stated that she was "against this idea."
The government still has three years for the chance to clear the "misunderstanding" that the “poor workers” are making labor policy, revitalize social dialogue, and reach out to the labor-respecting society.
Only the members of the public interest committee who submitted their resignations after the reform plan came out, if the dual plan was a ploy to change the members who participated in the double-digit increase, then it would be a violation.
Even if it is social dialogue for labor, management, and government to participate as equals, it is up to the government and politics to plan and design a place for dialogue anyway.
The Economic, Social & Labor Council needs a majority of participation from each field of workers, users and the government in the vote, but three out of four labor committee members are not allowed to vote as representatives from different classes are absent from the meeting.
The Economic, Social & Labor Council Act stipulates that at least one-half of each of the representatives of workers, representatives of users, and representatives of governments must attend the committee's vote.
The Economic, Social & Labor Council recommended that the three worker committee members improve their roles and operational problems, and return quickly and actively speak their opinions.
Discussions and decisions have been made on economic and social issues, such as the expansion of the unit period for elastic workers and agenda items related to the ratification of the International Labor Organization (ILO)'s key agreement.
The operation, until the law is revised, will inevitably be reduced to a level that follows the previous discussion by the Korean Conflict of Trade Unions which was absent.
An unexpected significant loophole is revealed in the operation of Economic, Social & Labor Council.
When it was launched in November last year, there were high expectations that it would discuss and agree on various pending issues for realizing a labor-respecting society.
As service businesses based on platforms that connect online and offline expand, the surge of platform workers engaged in them is a case in point.
If the Economic, Social & Labor Council did not assume their role as bridesmaids in the first place, they should have considered their opinions and roles in the decision-making process fully.
The three workers' committee members expressed as 'the cartel with the most power' and criticized that it can not be a social dialogue.
If this concealment is true, the problem becomes even worse.
Such excuses that manpower and budget compared to institutions in advanced countries is lacking or that licensing fees are far lower than those in the U.S. should not be preceded.
The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety is said to be testing whether the gene transporter in question is killed, as Kolon Life Sciences claims, but has also mentioned plans to conduct long-term follow-ups on patients, raising anxiety.
If one listens to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety announcement as it is, it is also suspected that Invossa only listened to the manufacturer and did not confirm whether cartilage-induced cells were existing and delivery cells have died or not.
The first priority is to explain to the public where it went wrong.
In addition, some even point out that if it is true that Invossa-K Injection used kidney-induced cells, it could cause a tumor.
Even so, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety has estimated the total number of domestically administered 3,957 cases, and 3,400 patients, even considering double doses.
Kolon said that it had known that the cells had been reversed in February this year, but it was also related to the suspicion that it already knew that cell components were different two years ago.

There are public notices posted on Weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter, on the 21st that some Chinese companies advised employees not to buy U.S. products.
He also inspected rare earth-related industrial facilities, hinting that "the suspension of exports of rare earths" could be used as a card to the U.S.
Watchers say it is the beginning of a Chinese-style Retaliatory War in which the Chinese government hints at conflicts with foreign countries and the people rush like bees.
As US and IT companies, including Google, cut off their ties with Huawei, deepening US-China conflict has fueled US boycott campaigns in China.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport did not specify the manufacturer, but chose China DJI, which accounts for about 80% of the drones used in the US and Canada, as a target.
Samsung Electronics is expecting positive trend to continue for a while as it is lending its weight to affordable Smartphones to secure market share and Galaxy Note series, which are flagship Smartphones, are set to be released in second half of this year.
MCNEX's quarterly sales rose 60.7 percent YOY to 250.8 billion won and operating profit also rose 179.1 percent YOY to 19.6 billion won.
The rise in the domestic camera module industry is a result of Samsung Electronics' reorganization of its mid- and low-priced smartphone lineup into the Galaxy A and Galaxy M series, which significantly improved camera performance.
In fact, the performance of its partners that supply camera-related parts such as modules, lenses, and filters to Samsung smartphones has significantly increased.
Despite the stagnation of smartphones, the main reason for the increase in the performance of camera parts manufacturers is that the demand for related components has soared as the number of cameras mounted per smartphone has increased.
As smartphones become popular, the market is formed with around 1.4 billion units per year.
An official of the domestic camera module industry said, "The multi-camera trend is expected to continue, so the outlook for the second half is cautious, but there is hope for earnings improvement in the first half."
According to the Office of Education, schools that control city-run areas are not allowed to register new buildings on the building management register when building additions, limiting the effectiveness of management.
There have been attempts by political circles to revise the law in recognition of the problems that are occurring at the educational site, but the passage is still pending due to political strife.
Representatively, the Education Office has not been able to extend the gym for students in Seobinggo Elementary School located in Yongsandistrict, Seoul, as about 80% of the school's entire area is state-owned.
There is a case of schools built on city land rebuilt after agreement. For example, the office of education and Gangnam-gu signed an agreement in February 2017 to extend the Seoul Daedo Elementary School building and register the building register under the superintendent of education's name.
There are also concerns that it is not easy to rebuild shools built on city or national land even if they are old and the safety of the students may be threatened.
In the case of city land, the mayor and the superintendent of education are representatives of the same local government, so the problem can be resolved through consultations, but the national land is legally blocked from building and extneding and altering educational facilities due to the National Property Law.
For schools built in state-owned lands, the problem is more serious.
In terms of overall proportion of 29.1%, three out of ten schools have different owners of buildings and land.
Seobing elementary school is built on land owned by other ministries, but other state-owned schools are often built on land owned by the Ministry of Education.
The police investigating charges of malpractice and assault by JTBC president Sohn Suk-hee have decided to hand the case to the prosecution after concluding that president Sohn was not chared with malpractice.
The police and the prosecution concluded that Son did not actually commit breach of trust, which constitutes an attempted breach of trust, and that it is difficult to apply the breach of trust charges solely through talks with Kim.
The official then added that "the prosecution needs to look further into all charges, including breach of trust, even if they were sent to the court with the opinion of the nonindictment.
Kim informed the police that Sohn assaulted him at 11:50 p.m on the 10th of Jan at a Japanese pub in Sangam-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul.
The police judged that there was no charge of infringement because CEO Son did not do anything specific to the fact that it can be considered as executing infringement.
In those days, there was a lack of help for the visually impaired, so a semester would end while translating book for the major subject into Braille.
"I won't be distracted." Since former presidents were not trusted due to corruption, he said that if we would be transparent, fair, and communicate, we would be able to bring the school back to normal in the near future.
It was since he was 15 years old that he had been blind.
The members of the Chongshin University in crisis did not have a better solution.
He also expressed confidence in how to resolve the complex situation in the school, with a joke, "I have nothing to lose."

The conflict between the ride-sharing service and the taxi industry is drawn out.
Controversy over illegality grows due to lack of innovation issues.
If you deny that it is not innovation, you have no choice but to appeal by law.
In 1917 Duchamp presented his urinal, which he purchased at New York's Murtha, to an exhibit by the Association of Independent Artists he was a member of, but published the fact in a magazine when not accepted.
The situation of fine dust, which has become a commodity and instigated fear in the eyes of the author, who is a scientist and environmental activist, caused a radical cry of "opposition to an air-selling society."
The author of this book, who has studied fine dust for over 30 years, tries a scientific and statistical approach through thorough analysis of how dust is used in our times.
A new book has emerged that focused on the strange events that 'dust', which was created 100 years ago by Duchamp in New York as a work of art, survived on the Korean peninsula for the last five years.
The fact that the traces of dust were recorded by the photograph, the art of light, the accumulation of dust, the creation of strange figures, and most of all, the fact that it was created without going through Duchamp's hands, reset the value hierarchy of art and emphasized what novelty is.
This is why we pay attention to the story of two men 100 years ago when dust was being sold as another dust and strange dust was being cultured, and a man brought environmental movements to an artistic level.
With fine dust pollution not worse compared to the past and never bad in the world, how can we explain the situation in which masks and air purifiers become necessities and portable air purifiers and oxygen cans are released continuously?
"The dust work," which was left only as a photo because Duchamp cleaned up the dust after the photoshoot, is an important opportunity to lead the working world of Duchamp later.
After the broadcast, the Instagram of the Grand Library post comments from 100 minutes of discussion viewers as well as netizens who insist on whether or not the game addiction phenomenon should be considered a disease.
Roh Sung-won, a professor of psychiatry at Hanyang University's medical school, and Kim Yoon-kyung, director of the Citizens' Solidarity for the Prevention of Internet dependence, argued against the idea.
With the World Health Organization (WHO) nearing a decision on whether to include game addiction in the disease, civic debate continues on SNS at the one-man Creator's Grand Library, which appeared on the debate show.
Netizens who say "game is disease" and "It is prejudiced to see the game as disease'" crowded and are debating by leaving comments.
According to the game industry and the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, the WHO plans to approve a revision to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), which will designate game addiction as a disease, at its general assembly held in Switzerland from the 20th to 28th (local time).

Chairman Choi explained that "the question of how to protect the classes that lag behind innovation is an important and difficult task for the government."
Chairman Choi also said, "I cannot help but worry that if innovators act with arrogance, they will weaken the power of the overall innovation in society."
This seems to have aimed at a post rep. Lee posted on his Facebook account on the 17th when the taxi driver self-imolated, which said, "death shouldn't be used for profit nor should it be politicized."
While Hong Nam-ki, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance, explaining a reason why a civilian director position of the Innovative Growth Development Council was disappeared in the last month, he said, “if the former director did his job according to his position and had his own will to do.”
As the government and the industry have made loud and small friction over the method and pace of innovation growth, the conflict seems to have deepened.
It was because the late believer approached the morning worship service and performed holy Sunday and was chased by the busy work as vice president, but did not miss Wednesday night worship and Friday night worship.

"I didn't like it because it was a fake," was a quick step in the relationship between the two, which almost ended in a minor misunderstanding, to progress.
His sharp gaze and sharp words express his role to its fullest in every word of the lines, raising expectations for the character he will portray in the future.
The narcissism-filled mentions combined with the appeal of an adult man Kim Jae-wook, which instantly captivated viewers by creating a unique sexy atmosphere.
The dialogue that was the turning point where fake becomes real, stimulated the viewers' love cells in earnest and played a key role in making Kim Jae-wook, fully armed with excitement, more expectant of the spring romance to be drawn.
This was the driving force behind them never missing class.
This class is part of the Gyeonggi-Province Educational Community Project, in which schools provide the space for education and culture for the community.

Renault Samsung Motors fell into chaos again as 2018 wage & collective bargaining tentative agreement, which had been deduced by the labor and management with much difficulties in 11 months, was rejected in the labor-management cross-voting.
The labor union of Renault Samsung Motor Co. said on the 22nd, "The high rate of opposition to its sales branches was due to a large amount of job insecurity caused by outsourcing services and the base salary lower than the Busan plant minimum wage, which resulted in more underperformance."
Renault Samsung Motors' labor union has had four previous attempts in the past five years -- 2014, 2016, and 2017 -- to reject wage and collective agreement negotiations in the first round of voting.
Labor leaders held an emergency meeting and prepared follow-up measures. They will enter a tent sit-in from the 27th to urge the company for sincere negotiations.
Some worry that the situation may be prolonged as the labor union has to engage in renegotiations with the company with a new negotiation agenda.
On the day, Roh Yong-jin, a professor (business administration) at Seoul National University of Science and Technology, released the results of a survey conducted to figure out what mechanism the big minimum wage hike works with in the labor market.
Small and medium-sized companies were already in bad business conditions, but they have experienced a major change of minimum wage increase without any countermeasures, which has added to their anxiety.
As eight members of the public interest committee from the Minimum Wage Council that determines the minimum wage have resigned, they have not even taken the first step for discussion until the end of May.
Small and medium-sized manufacturing in the industrial complex had a clear reduction in working hours rather than a reduction in employment.
It is unclear whether the discussions will be made properly as labor and management and experts are also controversial over the "speed-control theory" of the minimum wage.
As a result, 37 car manufacturers and importers are estimated to have sold 7,010 vehicles subject to the recall without taking corrective measures.
It turned out that the Korea Transportation Safety Authority was aware of similar cases before a series of engine fires in BMW vehicles last summer, but was sitting on its hands.
The Board of Audit and Inspection has asked the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport Minister to review whether to recall nine models that have issued recommendations for free repair, and notified them to investigate cars subject to the recall so that they are not sold without correction.
Unlike recalls, free repairs are not obligated to report correction rates (repaired or restored ratios), to notify individual owners, and to notify the newspaper of the contents of the recall.
For general recalls, the correction rate is 82.6 percent, while nine cases recommended for free repairs have only 17.8 percent on average, raising concerns that it could disrupt safe operation.
From August 2015 to March last year, there were six of the same or similar cases as the cause of the BMW vehicle engine fire.
The Korea Transportation Safety Authority received a report from BMW owners in November 2017, said "it was proved by BMW that the sludge of 'the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR)' cooler part caused a fire," but it did not conduct an analysis or investigation.
Nine out of 60 cases reported by the Korea Transportation Safety Authority between January 2013 and June 2018 needed a recall, depending on the results of the production defect investigation.
With nine cases being handled like this, as many as 1.06 million vehicles that needed to be recalled due to safety operational problems received simple free repairs without legal basis.
According to the results of an audit released by the Board of Audit and Inspection on the 22nd, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport decided to recommend free repair of cars instead of issuing a recall, citing resistance from manufacturers, even after confirming defects in manufacturing.
The Financial Times analyzed the latest annual report published by the FTSE100 and found in their SNS profiles that most of the senior auditors responsible for the company were white.
One of them said, "Considering the efforts to promote many women into partner positions in the 1990s, there should be more senior female partners among the top 100 corporate auditors."
The penalty fee in question is related to the capital impairment amounting to EUR 1.5 billion belatedly discovered after Co-op Bank acquired the Britannia Building Society bank in 2009.
Among the major auditors responsible for the UK's most influential companies, UK's top business and political figures are outraged by the severe shortage of women and minorities.
"These figures indicate that the global Big Four is behind the times and is not following social changes," pointed out Sharon Bowles, a strong candidate for the new British accounting regulator.
As most of the senior auditors of the UK's top 100 listed companies (FTSE 100) are identified as white males, there is criticism the male-centric audit culture of the global Big Four accounting firm.
Because his analysis uses the average wage, it could rise even if the wages of the lower income earners remain stagnant and the wages of the upper income earners only rise.
Professor Park pointed out that the analysis of the finance officer Park Jong-gyu made a interpretation error.
Many international studies often use this method.
Even if wages rise as much as GDP, the role of income-driven growth remains.
When looking at a change in wages in terms of laborer's consumption, not in terms of production, a method of calculating real wages using the consumer price index is used.
If bread prices rise faster than banana prices, workers' lives will be tougher, even if thelabor income distribution rate remains the same.
Rather than healthy people, the disease usually occurs in people with impaired liver function or immune function such as alcoholism and chronic renal failure.
According to the Ministry of Health and Environment of Chungcheongnam-do on the 21st, 'Vibrio vulnificus', a vibrio septicemia, has been detected in 30 septic sites in six western coasts since April.
In South Chungcheong Province, two people were infected with vibrio septicemia in 2016 (one death), three in 2017 (two deaths), and six last year, and the number of infectees and deaths is on the rise.
In particular, because the fatality rate is very high at around 50%, medical institutions should be immediately visited for proper measures to be taken if symptoms are suspected.
The infection pathways eat raw fish and shell contaminated with vibrio or can be transmitted through the skin if a person with a wound comes into contact with contaminated seawater.
Vibrio sepsis was first detected this year in seawater off the west coast of Chungnam.
Managing Director Lim's resignation will begin on July 1, and it will hold regular consumer meetings to listen to customers' opinions and explain from June, CEO Park added.
The Internet shopping mall "Imbley," which started with the pumpkin juice scandal and has been entangled with various rumors, held a press conference to apologize. It announced the resignation of its executive director Lim Ji-hyun and the introduction of a professional management system.
It is pointed out that although Managing Director Lim is said to be stepping down from management due to her immature response to consumers, her continuing activities as an influencer have not changed from before.
Since then, controversy has intensified amid a series of controversies over the sale of luxury design copy products and allegations that foreign materials came out from cosmetics brand Vely Vely products.
Regarding the professional management system, CEO Park also gave a vague answer, saying, "We have not yet decided on whether a person of CEO level will come or a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) will come."
In 2017, there were rumors of reduced menstruation, irregular menstruation, and menstrual pain after using certain sanitary pads in the women's community and social networking services.
The council last year conducted a preliminary survey of 50 women whose health effects from the use of disposable sanitary pads lasted more than three months.
I looked up the detailed test results and it was very difficult to read and understand the contents.
In September of the same year, the Justice Party petitioned for a health impact survey and two months later, when the Environmental Health Committee accepted the petition, a Joint Public-Private Cooperation on Health Impact Surveys on Sanitary Pads" was formed in December 2017.
The forum was held to discuss tasks to secure the safety of sanitary pads by academic organizations related to environment and health, political parties and civic groups.
This is due to the lack of understanding of labor issues in our society.
The person, who knows the meaning of "Gwangju in May" and honors it, has such a desperate and sincere heart to convey the truth to others.
After the class was over, the student came up and said.
To be very careful, every May, I envy Gwangju, which is the subject of so many conscientious citizens.
Many ordinary citizens, as well as executives and conservative politicians, have a negative point of view on the KCTU.
Even though "labor" is an equally important agenda, there are many cases where even the "awakened citizens" do not see it in our society.
One student suddenly appeared to look of dismay when I was explaining the impact of modern and contemporary Korean history of 40 years of colonization and 70 years of division, in which 30 were under a military government, on labor issues.
At the beginning of the next class, the student was waiting in the hallway of the classroom entrance and unexpectedly said, "It'd be better not to publicize anything."

While 81.3% (78.9% in 2018) of children of the national and public kindergartens use afternoon care, they point out that it is urgent to take measures as they need efficient customized care considering local characteristics (industrial complex, farming and fishing villages) and demand for evening care from working parents.
According to the Ministry of Education, the expansion of national and public kindergartens is being carried out in accordance with "the plan to expand national and public kindergartens and service improvement", which was announced in December last year.
The Ministry of Education said, "Starting next year, all private kindergartens will use EduFine, which is expected to contribute to reinforcing accounting transparency and restoring confidence in childhood education."
The plan is to expand purchase-type kindergartens to areas with a low percentage of public kindergartens.
"We will listen to and communicate difficulties in operating public and private kindergartens through local kindergarten councils and central unit councils, and come up with development measures for public and private kindergartens to coexist," said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education Yoo Eun-hye.
Josh Lindblomm's nine successes were recorded by Lee Young-ha, Seth Furankov six times, Lee Yong-chan five times, and Yu Hee-gwan four times.
In that respect, the sluggishness of Lotte and KIA is likely to be prolonged.
On the contrary, Hanwha Eagles have the least quality start.
Brooks Riley has six times and Kim Won-joong five times playing a certain role, but Jake Thompson has only three times and Jang Si-hwan has only one.
There may be a number of factors, but it is not unrelated to starting pitchers' competitiveness.
If the starting pitcher collapses early, the game is not easy to win.
"As the number of matches increases, the bullpen may be overloaded and as a result, it can be seen that Hanwha has the task of strengthening the power of selection in order to be in the 6th place."

Senior grade teachers at Gunpo High School (principal Jeong Gyu-seong) had held a one-night-two-days workshop at the Bukhansan Mountain Ecological Education Training Institute on Feb. 28 and March 1 before the semester began.
It was a school that local residents did not pay much attention to at the time of its opening, but now it marks the 30th anniversary of its opening, boasting high college entrance performance every year and is promoting its name as a prestigious high school in the region.
Instructor Kim said "I just informed students of the advantages and disadvantages of supplementary classes and self-directed studying, but when we actually implemented them, there were more applicants than when we forced them to do it."
To that end, we will create better facilities and environments to pave the way for teachers and students to pursue their studies more freely and seriously.
Last year, 89 admissions officers from 65 universities visited Gunpo High School, and this year, there are also scheduled admission seminars for more than 50 universities.
Every year, Gunpo High School holds a special lecture invitiing the seniors after CSAT.

After punching and kicking in the air in front of a hotel in Nonhyeon-dong at around 1 a.m. this day, he laid down on the road, and around 3 p.m., he threw himself onto the road where cars were driving.
There is a separate smoking booth at the moment, but as the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) considers this smoking booth as an internal area and thus non-smoking area, the plan is to increase the smoking area instead of the smoking booth.
To prevent secondhand smoking from smokers going outside to smoke, smoking areas are designated far away from pedestrian passages.
The law will be revised so that those who are fined for smoking in non-smoking areas can have a half of the fine if they receive a three-hour anti-smoking education.
In this way, the warning picture and the phrase occupy 70% of the cigarette pack, and they will be seen even if the pack is set upside down in a convenience store.
The Ministry of Health and Welfare added, saying, "We plan to ban the use cartoons or animal characters that interest children and adolescents for cigarette advertisements, and to make it obligatory to include subtitles for warning signs in videos featuring smoking scenes."

According to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the 20th, five people have been infected with Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS), or "wild mite syndrome", since this year it was first confirmed on the 2nd.
Among the infected, there is a high percentage of agriculture and forestry workers in their 50s.
If you have high fever of 38 ~ 40 degrees and digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea within 2 weeks after outdoor activities, you should see a doctor immediately.
According to the SFTS's result of the observation of the mediated Ixodid, "Ixodid Index" (the total number of Ixodid populations/collectors) was 54.4 in April, 51.7% higher than 35.8 in the same period of the last year.
Although most recover naturally after 7 to 10 days after symptoms occur, it might cause complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, paralysis etc.
In fact, Moon Jae-in administration, which highlighted the expansionary fiscal policy, actually implemented austerity policy, so there are controversial that its financial health is better than the former conservative government.
South Korea has the characteristics of an open economy that is highly dependent on the overseas market
Fortunately, Korea is now very rich in financial capacity.
Indeed, fiscal authorities say that in the past five years, national debt has increased by nearly KRW 200 trillion, but the interest burden has rather decreased.
In 2009, right after the global financial crisis, the fiscal balance was -4.1 percent of GDP, the largest deficit in more than a decade, and also -2.4 percent in 2015 under the Park administration.
In order to help the public participate in the exercise, the government will focus on hands-on education for people's safety, such as a practice for people's actions, wearing gas masks, and CPR education.
And by applying cutting-edge technologies of the 4th industrial revolution such as robots to improve the capabilities for national crisis response and wartime preparedness, it is expected that a country where people can live safely and well could be created.
The practice of responding by central department, local governments, managing department and related organizations by implementing an organic crisis management system will raise the national disaster management capacity to the next level.
Just as public interest and support have been of great help in the recent extinguishment of forest fires and restoration of damage in Gangwon-do, the public's attention and participation are needed to create a strong national security by filling in gaps.
If the state-of-the-art video transmission equipment is used to send the situation and response position for the disaster site to the Central Disaster and Safety Situation Room, a situation evaluation meeting for national crisis management will be held simultaneously with 40 organizations participating in the video.
It appears to be concerned that the controversy could escalate as it violated the U.N. Security Council's resolution to sanction North Korea, which bans the launch of all kinds of ballistic missiles if the projectile is a ballistic missile.
The two countries are trying to persuade North Korea to engage in dialogue again through behind-the-scenes contacts with the North, while delaying the announcement of the analysis results.
"I think improving inter-Korean relations and easing military tensions are also greatly helpful for denuclearization talks between the U.S. and North Korea," Moon said at the meeting.
It evaluated the passage that Korea and the United States had lowered their voices about the launch of new tactical guided weapons and short-range missiles by North Korea on the 4th and 9th.
Because of the phrase "dando" that comes out when a person pronounces its ballistic missile weakly, analysts from South Korea and the U.S. at one time suggested that the projectile was identified as a ballistic missile.
Japan's pressure on South Korea with a "reference to the Arbitration Commission" even though there is little chance of it happening, should be seen as a political gesture.
If Japan really wants to resolve the dispute, it is right to withdraw its order to refuse compensation and consultation given to Japanese companies.
When Korea failed to respond to the "diplomatic consultations," it took follow-up measures with the dispute resolution procedures of the 1965 Korea-Japan Claims Agreement.
This kind of pressure is a one-sided act that ignores the fact that Korea is a democratic state of trilateral separation, and does nothing to solve the problem.
The Korean government also has no reason to hesitate to engage in Dialogue with the Japanese government in any way to improve the worst Korea-Japan relations.
According to the China Automobile Distributors Association, in 2018, China's new car sales totaled 28.08 million vehicles and used car transactions of 13.82 million units, less than half of new car sales.
In particular, exports of used cars are expected to stimulate consumption of new cars in China at a time when the Chinese auto market is in a slump.
The auto industry, China's key industry, recorded negative growth for the first time last year (-2.8% growth in sales), and the Chinese government took out the "used car export" card and began searching for a new way.
On the 6th, the Ministry of Commerce of China announced on the official website that "the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Hai Guan General recently held a conference on the export of used cars and officially started the export of used cars."
The report predicted that once used car exports began, many would try to sell old cars and buy new ones.
Considering that used car transactions amount to twice the sales volume of new cars and used car exports account for 10% of the total transaction volume in developed economies, China's used car exports are expected to have great potential.
Kim Gun-mo said, “If I were forced to marry, I might be unhappy.” When he said he might not get married, Kim Gun-mo's father told him about his marriage.
Kim Gun-dae's father, Kim Sung-dae, first appeared on a show of SBS "Ugly My Baby" starring his son and wife in September, 2017.
When I worked for a company and lived in lodgings near Ewha Womans University, and my colleague's friend was my mother.
"I never thought about seeing such a scene." Lee Sun-mi, who was watching father and his son racing in the studio, said, worried about their safety.
Afterwards, that he overtook his son, Kim Gun-mo, who ran first at high speed, to catch his son, and the father who eventually won the game was rejoicing was aired.
The issue of extending the working period of the special parliamentary committee on political reform and the special parliamentary committee on judicial reform, which will end on the 30th of next month, could also serve as an ambush.
Referring to the previous day's meeting, also Na Kyung-won, floor leader of the Liberty Korea Party, said, "The National Assembly's debacle that began on the 29th of last month should not exceed a month."
However, it is unclear whether the talks between the ruling and opposition parties will pick up speed as the Democratic Party is reluctant about some of the conditions demanded by the Liberty Korea Party regarding the normalization of the National Assembly.
In order to pass the extra budget bill as soon as possible, the Democratic Party is also talking about delaying the term of the special members of the National Assembly's budget and accounts committee, which expires on the 30th until the budget supplement bill process.
The Liberty Korea Party has also demanded the withdrawal of the charges against their member under the fast-track political circumstances, but the Democratic Party of Korea is known to have firmly determined "not to drop the charges."
The Bareunmirae Party started a preliminary analysis of the additional revision budget submitted by the government.
It was pointed out that the supplementary budget proposal submitted by the government to the National Assembly on the 25th of last month has not been deliberated for one month.
On May 18, at the Gwangju Democratization Movement's 39th Anniversary Ceremony, they lamented, using violent terminologies such as "dictator's descendants'' and "political consciousness in the Yushin era'' regarding the delay in the investigation of 5.18 truth.
It is hard to blame the opposition party alone to have provided the extreme confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties.
President Moon also mentioned the need to find out the truth about Jang Ja-yeon, the former vice minister Kim Hak-ui and the Burning Sun incident in Gangnam Seoul, which has drawn keen public attention.
In particular, President Moon said, "The International Monetary Fund recommended a 9 trillion won extra budget for us, but the government's extra budget plan is much smaller than that," and urged "the National Assembly should help in strengthening the government's efforts."
President Moon said, “As there is a lot of concern about the economy among the people, I would like to ask for prompt review and handling so that the revised supplementary budget can be effective without delay.”
It remains to be seen whether the other two cases mentioned by President Moon, along with the substantive truth, will lead to a punishment for the authorities' deliberate botched investigation or attempted indulgence by an authority.
The National Assembly has begun talks between floor leaders to pass the extra budget bill and will soon begin detailed consultations, but controversy over the practice is inevitable.
It's a kind of rebuttal to the opposition party's "criticism on misrule", however some worry it can be seen as an attitude that "the government is doing everything well, but the political community grabs its ankle."
The government submitted a 6.7 trillion won extra budget plan to cope with forest fires and other safety areas as well as economic vitality, but it has been suspended as the National Assembly continued its extreme confrontation over fast-track issues.
Above all, it is feared that the public will lose confidence in the president's words.
Major economies such as the U.S. (0.78 percent) and Germany (0.42 percent) maintained positive growth, and China, which is not an OECD member, also exceeded market expectations with 6.4 percent of GDP growth in the first quarter.
Many of the increase in the number of employed people are temporary workers, such as senior citizens' work volunteers, made with taxes.
Cheong Wa Dae only selects and interprets the figures that favor of the ruling camp, and the president is repeatedly talking about them in public as if nothing is wrong with that.
Japan, which had expected that there would be a high possibility of 'zero growth' or 'minus growth', reported a 'surprise growth rate' of 0.5% (2.1% based on annual rate).
Senior secretary Chung cited the fact that the average increase in the number of employed people last year was 97,000 and it became 250,000 in March and 170,000 in April this year and called it a "groundbreaking change".
It is highly likely that internal problems, not external ones, especially the mistakes of economic management, were the cause.
Gyeonggi Province, Yongin City and SK Hynix are planning to establish a win-win cooperation center within the Yongin Semiconductor Cluster with spaces for research on start-ups of large and small businesses and education centers to operate programs and develop localization of equipment and components to strengthen semiconductor capabilities.
Gyeonggi Province, Yongin City, SK Hynix, and SK Engineering & Construction have agreed to form a large semiconductor cluster that will house SK Hynix and more than 50 semiconductor equipment, materials, and parts companies from South Korea and abroad at the Yongin Semiconductor Cluster.
Gyeonggi Province and Yongin City predict that the creation of the Yongin Semiconductor Cluster will create astronomical ripple effects, including the creation of about 17,000 direct jobs, 513 trillion won worth of production, the creation of 188 trillion won worth added value, and the employment inducement of 1.48 million people.
"Yongin Semiconductor Cluster", which will be built on 4.48km2 (about 1.35 million pyeong) on Wonsam-myeon, Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, will be created as a win-win cluster where large, small and medium-sized companies, and local residents can grow together.
Gyeonggi Province and Yongin City plan to complete an integrated review of the industrial complex plan and approve the industrial complex plan by next year and help start construction of the site in 2021.
A win-win cooperation center for large and small businesses will be established within Yongin Semiconductor Cluster and a win-win fund will be created.
No recent Islamic extremist terror has occurred in Switzerland.
Switzerland has developed a gun culture such as shooting sports and hunting.
It was also the last time in 2001 that a large number of people died in an accidental shooting spree.
Similar terrorist attacks in the U.K., Germany and Belgium have also caused casualties.
If they're kicked out of here, they'll have a lot of economic damage.
It overcame the tragic tragedy of a desolate market and became a milestone for their first success, which showed that modern R&B in Korean style is possible anytime.
The parade of great success on compilation albums instantly showed how poor the Korean music industry has been in producing contents.
Income has entered a path of polarization, and the number of non-regular workers has soared over the years, and the myth of full employment has completely collapsed, deepening the unpredictability.
Even among musicians, the black style music was playfully called "Sampyo Music" (probably derived from Sampyo briquettes), so its status should not be further stated.
Artistic confidence that it no longer expresses anger at social issues such as racism and win control of music solely through refined and polished techniques is the essence of Urban style.
The Soribada scandal, an online P2P site in 2000, and the compilation album "Yeonga" incident in 2001 are important topics that sum up the reality of the Korean music industry during this period.
Many of the previous compilation albums "legally" filled the gap created by the disappearance of a collection of hit songs from illegal tapes sold on handcarts after being forced out of the crackdown.
Despite the existence of early Korean R&B heroes such as Park In-soo and Kim Choo-ja, ballads based on standard pop has always dominated the focus of western-style Korean pop music.
It was at this point that the dark shadows of youth unemployment slowly eroded the Korean peninsula.
Two people who did not realize their ambitions in each team met.
NIS did not report specific details of North Korea's additional nuclear facilities because of security reasons in its closed report on the National Assembly Intelligence Committee.
However, it is presumed that South Korea's intelligence authorities did not know exactly whether President Trump demanded the shutdown of the five facilities during the collapse of the second summit between North Korea and the U.S.
Lee Hye-hoon, chairman of the intelligence committee, said after receiving a report from the National Intelligence Service in March, "I thought there were additional nuclear facilities outside of the perimeter while listening to several reports."
A key Cheong Wa Dae official replied, "We cannot confirm" whether to identify the 5 lists, but it seems that South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were already sharing the same information.
The National Intelligence Service is known to have identified five North Korean nuclear facilities mentioned by US President Donald Trump.
The People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy said on the 20th, “We welcome the Supreme Court's ruling and the National Assembly should revise additional laws to protect merchants doing business a a rental place, who are still in the blind spot of deposit protection opportunity due to the lack of law.”
It is believed that the property values of customers, clients, and credit formed by tenants are still maintained after five years of commercial rentals, and that there is a need to guarantee the leaseholder's right to retrieve the key money.
The Supreme Court decided on the 16th, "The lessor would be obligated to protect the opportunity to recover the key money if it meets the requirements set out in clause 4 of Article 10, regardless whether the total lease period exceeds five years."
Judge Oh Hyeon-seok told SNS on the 19th, "In 2016, there were many cases of factual judgments that disapproved if the lease lasted more than five years, saying that if there was no right to renew, there was no right to claim for compensation for not recovering the key money. "
The plaintiff, who is a tenant, operated a restaurant by renting the store building from the leaser, who is a defendant, from October 8, 2010, and the lease period expired on October 7, 2015 because the lease contract was renewed twice.
Under Article 10 of the old Commercial Rental Protection Act, a lessee can exercise its right to renew a contract for a tenant before the contract expires, but it is impossible to exercise the renewal request if the entire lease term exceeds five years (the current law is 10 years).
It has been confirmed that there are 3 times more men than women at this stage.

Concerns are mounting that European far-right politicians, including former Deputy Prime Minister Strauss-Kahn, are holding some kind of string against Russia.
The far-right forces, which have been expanding their power ahead of the European Parliament elections, have faced a series of unfavorable factors.
Following a corruption video scandal involving former Austrian Deputy Prime Minister Heinz Christian Strahe, Fidesz, a far-right party led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, was exposed to widespread election fraud in last year's Hungarian general elections.
"With this video scandal, the European far-right parties, which are Russia's puppets, will collapse like dominos, starting with Vice Prime Minister Strache," said István Ujhelyi, a Hungarian member of the European Parliament.
Earlier visits to Russia by Vice Premier Matteo Salvini, who leads the far-right party alliance in Italy, and other members of the Alternative for Germany's far-right party (AfD), to the Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia were also controversial.
However, it was made legal to rest on Sunday, when Jesus was revived, not Saturday.
For modern people in need of rest, the fundamental spirit of observance of Sabbaths comes with a special meaning.
Because seeing someone else working or studying makes me nervous about taking a break and eventually I can't help running to work or library.
This suggests where the potential of Jewish society comes from.
The 17th and 18th centuries are called 'the era of revolution.' One of the representative trends of this era was to change the orientation of mankind from 'Jerusalem' to 'Athens'.
There has been an attempt to abolish this system in human history.
It will be easy to guess what will happen if you do not rest a day or so a week in the modern world that emphasizes "Work and Life Balance".
The flower of the revolutionary era, however, was the French Revolution (1789), and the republican government, which was founded by the major force of the revolution, also presented rational-centered policies as its top priority.
The Sabbath observance commandment is a rule that clearly demonstrates God's love for man and his love for God and his neighbor above all else.
For example, if someone is looking for a restaurant or shopping mall to have a holiday, there are people who have to return the holiday for them.
For example, if there is a person who runs a company and he or she works nonstop on Sundays, it is highly likely that the employees of the company will not be able to take a break.
They were able to do so because they accepted resting once a week as a command from God.
According to market research firm Strategy Analytics (SA), Samsung Electronics held the No. 1 position with 21.7 percent of sharing rate in the global smartphone market in the first quarter of this year, but Huawei (17.9%) beat Apple and is chasing the top.
Samsung Electronics has only recovered 1% of the Chinese smartphone market in the first quarter of this year, and Chinese smartphone manufacturers' high market shares are the biggest wall.
Samsung Electronics, which is competing with Huawei for the first and second place in the global smartphone market, saw its stock price strengthen on the 21st, while LG Uplus, which is receiving Huawei's telecommunication equipment, saw its stock price drop, causing the Korean stock market to fluctuate as well.
They say that it will be an opportunity for Samsung Electronics as it is expected that sales of Huawei's Smartphones will be adversely affected by the suspension of U.S. businesses such as Google.
The U.S. government's sanctions on Huawei in China cause mixed feelings of joy and sorrow among Korean companies.
Fund types are offered to select based on gender and age in Chile.
Even if there is no specific operation instruction, it is intended to increase the profit rate by automatically investing money.
It is divided into defined benefit (DB) types, in which users (entities) decide how to operate the reserves and are responsible for the results of the operation, and DC types, in which employees decide how to operate the reserves and are responsible for the results of the operation.
Retirement pension reserves amounted to KRW 190 trillion as of the end of last year, but the yield is low.
Critics say that workers only agree to set retirement pensions and that companies often select financial companies based on interests such as existing loan transactions.
Retirement pension is a system that entrusts the retirement allowance to the financial company, and the company or worker decides how to operate and is paid it when retiring.
It has the advantages of being simple in operation and reducing costs, but it is difficult for workers to actively participate.
Most companies were negative due to possible legal disputes stemming from operating losses, but the system was established in 2006 with the creation of an exemption that would not hold companies accountable if the default option was set.
The company directly contracts with financial companies and entrusts the management of severance pay.
Ryu Kun-sik, a senior researcher at the Insurance Research Institute, said, “It is necessary to faithfully prepare in advance as the possibility of infringement of trustee liability may increase as the introduction of the fund-type retirement pension is discussed.”
Nam Jae-woo, a researcher at the Capital Market Institute, explained, “It is worth noting that a relatively conservative fund is set as the default option, but not the most conservative fund.”
"The specific service model is undecided, but the key is to try different services on different vehicles," an official involved in the discussion said.
The government says the parliamentary passage of a bill on the salary system for taxi drivers is a priority.
With an individual taxi driver taking his own life, amid a growing conflict between "Tada" and private taxis, Kakao Mobility and taxi groups have decided to sign an agreement to launch a "platform taxi."
"Regulatory innovation platform taxis" are suggested to include high-end taxis such as Genesis and K9, semi-high-end taxis such as K7, and van taxis using Carnivals.
It is expected that Tada and other mobility companies will protest.
The key is to launch a variety of models and services, including Genesis and Carnival.
If the amendment is passed, platform carriers such as Kakao Mobility will be allowed to carry out a "free from regulation" transportation business using some or all of their taxi licenses.

Ha-sun, who was thought as simple pneumonia, is actually suffering from a rare disease called obstructive bronchiolitis and one of the lungs became not functioning. When he/she almost hovers between life and death, the parent pray for their child's survival.
If the "Sky Castle" was a drama about the struggle to get to the top of the Korean society pyramid through the competition of university entrance examination, "School on Road" is a drama which shows poor pastor couple teaching the eleven children love instead of competition based on Words and meeting glory of God.
The fair, which was held to mark the 14th anniversary of the establishment of the practice shrine, presented research tasks that will allow students to implement "God's country" by applying them to pastoral sites such as missionary service, counseling, worship and education.
Professor Long explains, "Luke's parable teaches us that the kingdom of God lies in the weak, the low, and the poor."
In the front yard of the Seoul Archbishop's Cathedral, 17 churches and organizations have set up booths to introduce models that can apply the kingdom of God to reality, and unveiled their know-how in private affairs.
Park Won-ho, president of the Graduate School of Practical Theology, introduced the site at the Seoul Archbishop's Cathedral on Monday, which marked the second day of the 'God's Country Pastoral Exhibition' on the 21st.
Park asserted, “As long as the Korean church aims to achieve "growth", we cannot find a solution to the crisis in our time.”
Pastoral meetings and Bible study for the realization of the kingdom of God were the topics.
This means that if a U.S. company wants to do business with Huawei, it needs government approval.
Bloomberg points out that the ousting of Huawei will result in collateral damage.
"The Donald Trump administration's attempt to oust Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications equipment maker, from the market is a serious mistake," Bloomberg highly criticized.
Bloomberg pointed out that "the U.S. administration insists there is no relationship between the stalled negotiation and expel of Huawei out of the market, but President Trump certainly seems to want to use Huawei as leverage."
The premise that the two countries are negotiating is "not only to increase trade but also to develop into a stable relationship for the world's No. 1 and No. 2 economies."
If it goes the same way again this time, it is likely to announce the results on the 26th afternoon.
Although the decision is made by the Financial Supervisory Service, the opinions of external assessment committee members are virtually absolute.
The Financial Services Commission has suspended screening of the eligibility of major shareholders as KT is under Fair Trade Comission's investigation for alleged collusion and the prosecution's investigation into KT Chairman Hwang Chang-gyu is under way.
An official of Financial Services Commission said, "We will reach a conclusion unconditionally within this month. It will be carried out in the form of Financial Supervisory Service to summarize the opinions of the external evaluation committee members and put them up at the FSC meeting."
The Internet-only bank, which is perceived as a symbol of financial innovation, was initially focused on innovation, but the importance of the assessment has been highlighted in terms of stability as K-Bank has recently struggled with capital increase by issuing new stock.
"Although there are different kinds of services from commercial banks, there are limitations in terms of competition in terms of size," a source in the finance said. "In comparison to commercial banks with Internet banking, innovation is not as big as expected."
At that time, a temporary financial meeting was held on Sunday afternoon, and two were accredited.
While the government expects over-production of 150,000 tons for the average year, it cannot prevent the fall of onion prices with the belated measures of isolating only 39,000 tons.
"The government stood idly when prices of winter cabbage, green onion, winter radish and carrots plummeted, and when it was demanded fundamental measures to stabilize onion prices, it announced measures to give up the stability of onion prices," the Onion Producers Association and the Korean Peasants League urged the government to "establish fundamental measures to stabilize prices."
The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs estimated that this year's estimated production of a variety of medium and late ripening increased from the ordinary years, but estimated that the production volume was 31,000 tons less than that of last year, but at the site, the figure is estimated to have increased by more than 200,000 tons from last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs announced on the 17th that it will isolate 39,000 tons from the market, assuming that a variety of medium and late ripening onion production will reach 1,281,000 tons, which is increased by 13% from the previous year.
They pointed out that since February, the price of onions has been falling, which is 25% lower than last year and 13% lower than normal last year, but government policy is still the same as last year ones.
There are not many differences of opinions within us over the issue of reunification.
Furthermore, once reconciliation and cooperation between the two Koreas is established and the de facto peace and unification between the two Koreas is institutionalized, the area for peaceful economic cooperation will be further expanded.
In this process, it's important to have an active posture that I put my hands out first.
Exemplary peace countries develop children's ability to resolve conflicts from their early ages.
Rather than unilateral education of the past, the future generation of unification values the experience of fostering the sensitivity of peace and reaching an agreement in everyday life.
The government has designated the fourth week of May as ”Unification Education Week” every year, providing opportunities for children and teenagers as well as ordinary people to think about peace and unification.
If unification is an effort to listen to the opinions of the other parties, find common ground, and gradually reduce differences, then unification is very close.
Throughout this week, various hands-on experience events on unification will be held at major universities, elementary, middle and high schools, Marronier Park, the local Unification Hall and Imjingak Pavilion.
In this demonstration project, social enterprises will conduct customized remodeling, and link local community facilities to supply two rental houses in Bupyeong and Juan for less than 80% of the surrounding prices by the end of the year.
The Metropolitan Corporation also plans to complete the mid-to-long-term urban regeneration strategy by June by speeding up its efforts to lay the groundwork for the Incheon-type urban renewal project with the goal of "Incheon, a special city for co-prosperity," in which the original city center and the new city are growing together.
Metropolitan Corporation has continuously pushed for greater participation of construction companies in Incheon in order to return the economic effects to the local economy as it pursues urban development projects with great economic effects.
Dotum House is a small-scale rental housing project of the Urban Construction Corporation which is currently seeking to supply remodeled rental housing by selecting a pilot project implementer.
Gumdan New City, which is being pushed forward by the city corporation this year, started supplying commercial land for the first time on 13th, and will supply two parcels for land of multi-use (residential and commercial) in June, as there are great interest from investors and actual consumers.
Incheon City Corporation (President Park In-seo) said that despite the recent slowdown in the real estate market, it posted sales of 68.1 billion won and net profit of 25.7 billion won last year, continuing the surplus trend for five consecutive years, and further strengthening the financial health.
According to the Land Supply Plan for Geomdan New Town this year, a total of 42 parcels will be supplied, including 8 parcels (sharing housing), 8 multi-purpose parcels (multi-use apartment), and 1 parcel (business office).
The new project, Geomdan 2 General Industrial Complex Development Project, was included in the (Gangso) R&D Special Zone (EcoScience Park) jointly promoted by the Ministry of Environment and Incheon City. It is currently selecting a company by ordering related services.
As a support project to improve housing satisfaction for residents of rental homes, various social contribution projects have been carried out, including emergency support for crisis families, job counseling services, alcohol addiction prevention campaigns, and home repair education projects.
Corporate rental businesses invested by the public construction company will build private rental houses within four years and lease them for eight years before selling them after 12 years.
The public corporation has recently signed a win-win agreement with major construction companies and LH Incheon Regional Headquarters to revitalize the local construction industry on two occasions, and has held presentations on construction materials, making various efforts to raise the ratio of local companies' participation in subcontracting.
In April, 300 labor unions and employees voluntarily donated KRW 10 million to help victims who suffered great damage from forest fires in the Gangwon area and to recover the damage as soon as possible.
Lotte Mart had a big chicken event in the past, but as a result, it was shocked by the backlash from local small business owners.
As entrepreneurs have different philosophies on corporate management, it is also necessary for the government to provide situation-specific standard guidelines for resolving the labor-management disputes and legislate them to resolve the disputes through reasonable conversation.
When consumer demand for products leads to purchasing power through the distribution market, it leads back to boosting manufacturing and bringing in additional investment.
The types of products and the duration whose price competition is conducted may vary depending on the circumstances, but this framework of extreme price competition will surely continue to exist for some time.
The issue of ultra-low price competition is not a conflict with small businesses.
"In order for income-led growth to be successful under the current administration, the overall pie in the economy should grow and jobs should be increased, but that is not the case," Chairman Kim said.
If you think about retail retailers, what should be a major player in the warm economy has become less than warm.
While the response from consumers is large, the backlash from local small business owners is not noticeable.
If you do not share the pain together, then the dispute is endless.
In the case of the market's contentious issues, it is too much for the government to unilaterally throw a policy and force it to accept the decision, as the government should make a decision together with people of various interests, such as the industry and workers.
Improving industrial structure and research and development (R&D) so that jobs can increase if the income-led economy is to gain momentum.
As jobs are shrinking, it is difficult for students to even find a part-time job.
In the case of big markets, a decrease in the number of customers visiting the store is inevitable as the specialized online malls such as the fresh food market are speeding up in passing through the market.
There is a great need to redefine the minimum wage, which has sharply increased for two years, by freezing it in the short term and by improving productivity in the long term.
It is important to note that the retail industry is competing to survive in the midst of domestic and international economic uncertainty with concerns about the economy and slowing growth rate at home and abroad.
The difficulty of the retail industry is proof of the poor national economy.
If labor is conflicting and rebellious, our economy is hopeless.
If blood and nutrients are not circulated normally through the small veins, life withers.
"We expect that the combined recruitment of 28 public institutions for innovation will produce tangible results in the future," said an official of the Board of Audit and Inspection.
Gwangju Metropolitan city Economy & Employment Promotion Agency, the Gwangju Cultural Foundation, and the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology did not properly go through the personnel committee's review when they turned their key workers into regular workers, while the Gwangju Metropolitan City Traffic Training Institute did not properly count the scores of interview reviewers when hiring new employees.
The Gwangju Lifelong Education Promotion Agency was found to have unfairly selected the final interviewee in 2017 by applying a rule that was not included in the test announcement during the recruitment process of two new employees.
In the case of the Kim Dae-jung Convention Center, it was revealed that employee A, who received a request from former mayor Yoon Jang-hyun of Gwangju, hired a son of Mrs. Kim (49, female, under arrest) who impersonated Kwon Yang-suk in January 2018 as a short-term contractor.
The Board of Audit and Inspection has issued administrative measures on 14 cases and notified that one person receive light punishment, four people receive warnings, and two receive disciplinary actions regarding their status.
Environmental Corporation of Gwangju and the Gwangju Transfer Support Center For The Vulnerable were found to have not used the manpower pool system as stipulated by selecting executives with acquaintances as interview review committee members, even though the final candidates for the 2018 interview included those who had previously worked as government officials and contract workers.
Gangwon Province had planned to install hydrogen charging stations in five locations in the province by the end of the year, but recently finalized the sites for the charging stations to be Gangneung and Samcheok.
As the government announced its plan to ease regulations on hydrogen charging stations, it is expected that local governments' projects to build infrastructure for hydrogen cars will expand further.
It also eased requirements for qualifications so that even if they are not qualified for gas functionaries, they can be appointed as the manager of safety management at charging stations once they complete training education.
Local governments are starting to build hydrogen car infrastructure under the atmosphere of government's expansion of hydrogen car infrastructure support and Hyundai's policy to strengthen hydrogen car and hydrogen electric car production system.
Local governments, which have focused on the distribution of electric cars for environmental protection and securing a new growth engine, are now turning their attention to hydrogen cars.
It is a film about grandmothers learning Korean and writing poetry late.
I'm afraid that everyone does not know the writing.
Grandmothers, who went through all kinds of storms, such as being born in Japanese occupation and experiencing the Korean War, were challenged by concerns alone over how to make a living, so there was no opportunity to learn Korean.
The weight of life that an illiterate person must bear can be guessed.
The excellence of Han-geul was praised over the fact that a British translator-author won the top literary award seven years after learning Korean.
In fact, according to "the Empirical Analysis and Policy Task Report on Financial Comprehension of Domestic Financial Consumers," there was a significant difference in the level of financial knowledge depending on the attendance of financial courses.
This is because in order to properly understand finance, it is necessary to make an effort to develop a view on the forest of markets and economies, rather than a tree of financial products.
In this era of change, we are well aware that if financial knowledge is not supported, it will be hard to protect our wealth.
There is no need to worry about saturated fats, antibiotics, and bacterial infections.
Genetic engineering technology used in the manufacturing process can also be controversial.
The meat alternative sector began with plant-based meat, but the finishing touches will be left to culture.
Meat alternatives includes cultured meat that is made by culturing animal cells in addition to plant meat.
Impossible Foods found that 90% of people who tasted Impossible Burgers think it's real meat.
The success of alternative meats must go beyond the walls of quality, price and eating habits.
The manufacturing technique patent document of Memphis Meats, a cultured meat developer, describes gene-editing technology.
Though support for the Liberty Party is still formidable in Busan, the situation is far different compared to circumstances in time of Roh's three defeats 19 years ago.
The Democratic Party of Korea which was always the opposition party in Busan replaced the local government in 23 years.
The reason why he was elected president was also to move forward toward the eradication of regionalism.
As Kim Young-sam joined the three parties, Busan's status changed from its long-term "opposition-province" to the "ruling-province" and became a stepping ground for conservative parties such as the Democratic Liberal Party, New Korea Party, Grand National Party, Saenuri Party, and Liberty Korea Party.
Even more surprising big changes took place in last year's local elections.
President Trump says he is willing to negotiate with the Democratic Party over how to protect DREAMers in the future, but when he came up with an immigration reform plan aimed at rallying Republicans from the start, he censures it is for election and political purposes.
Spouses of American citizens, minor children who are 21 years old or younger, and parents are currently classified separately as a direct family in family migration, and the green card can be issued without any annual limit.
The Democratic Party and immigrant community are also strongly opposing the Trump Republican Party, which is neglecting the family values in the United States and wants to reduce too many family-based immigration.
In the new Trump plan, the applicants will be given green cards from high scorers by scoring the age, education, English proficiency, and high-pay job offer of US companies.
The new US immigration reform plan, prepared by President's son-in-law Jarred Kushner for four months this year and approved by President Trump, is about to revamp the current US green card issuance system by 180 degrees.
Considering this situation, Washington has a negative and skeptical outlook that Trump's immigration reform is unlikely to be considered and approved before the 2020 election, even though it may go through legislation quickly.
Withdrawals of capital by foreign investors is an emergency in the stock market as the won value falls sharply.
The sensitivity to the slowdown of the economy has heightened as Korea's global trade and sensitivity to economic downturn have increased, as well as recording a negative growth compared to the previous quarter.
The Korean economy, coupled with the U.S.-China trade conflict, and the sluggish IT industry, is weakening economic fundamentals and hurting the supply and demand of dollars, widening the KRW's weakness.
The biggest victim of the U.S.-China trade conflict are Korea, not the U.S. or China.
Daishin Securities said the KOSPI is showing a sluggish trend compared to the global stock market, adding that there is a possibility that it could further expand the decline.
The biggest victim of the U.S.-China trade conflict is South Korea, and according to the experts, the KRW-USD exchange rate could exceed KRW 1,250 if the U.S.-China trade negotiation collapses.
In particular, experts say that Pyeongando has many types of historic sites such as buildings and houses (remaining in shape) and is of high importance.
The demonstrations in North Korea served as a flashlight for the spread of the Long Lived Movement, as six of the eight demonstrations on March 1, 1919, were in North Korea.
At that time, the region was well organized with Christian and other religious organizations, and the independence demonstrations were organized around religious circles.
The South Korean government announced plans to hold joint academic conferences and special exhibitions related to the March 1 Movement last year, when the Korean Peninsula was in the warm atmosphere.
It is expected that if inter-Korean relations improve, meaningful results can be made through academic exchanges such as joint surveys of historical sites in North Korea or sharing related historical records.
Although the March 1st march protests were active in the North, there were limitations in accessing data to understand the situation at that time. Accordingly, until now, research has not been done properly.
First, you need to investigate what literature is left on the north side.
As foreign investors have been "selling" for 7 consecutive days, the longest period of this year, and the exchange rate is showing no signs of slowing down, there is a serious concern about "Korea Exodus" in earnest.
Although the stock market index may rise slightly as a result of a sharp decline, some analysts say it is only a "dead cat bounce" that briefly rebounded from a steady decline.
In contrast, $1.8 billion was withdrawn from bond-type funds in emerging countries.
Some in the financial investment industry say that even if the stock index rebounded for the time being, it would be nothing more than a dead cat bounce.
"We will reduce exposure (money exposed to danger) to emerging market currencies and bonds until the US-China trade relationship and global economic direction become clear." US investment bank, Goldman Sachs said in its recent investment note.
This indicates that the selling trend could grow due to concerns over foreign-exchange loss.
"The basic reason for the steep rise in the won-dollar exchange rate is the weak economic conditions here," said Jeong Hoon-seok, a researcher at Korea Investment & Securities.
Kang Young-sook, a researcher at the Korea Center for International Finance, explained that the "'preference for safe assets' of global funds is being strengthened", adding that "emerging countries are clearly showing capital hemorrhage from both stocks and bonds".
Emerging country's equity funds have lost $6.2 billion over the same period, so a total of $4.3 billion have been lost compared to that last week.
Our government should actively manage Korea-Japan relations by making a quick decision in a way that can persuade the people,“ he said.
The Korean government expressed its intention to consider carefully, but there are opinions that it is difficult to resolve the issue through the arbitration commission due to the large disagreement between the two countries on the ruling that it must compensate victims who were forcibly taken.
It is said that Japan, which proposed the formation of an arbitration committee as well as diplomatic consultations under the Korea-Japan Claims Agreement, could take the issue of ruling on compensation for the compulsory manpower draft to the ICJ.
Prime Minister Lee Nak-yeon at a forum of the Korea News Editors' Association on the last 15th said on this issue, "While judicial proceedings are under way, it will not be in line with the principle of the separation of powers if the administration will do something for this".
After the request for arbitration is received to the other country within 30 days, South Korea and Japan are required to appoint one member of the arbitration committee of the third country within 30 days.
Japan began its request to hold the arbitration committee, the next step, after South Korea did not respond to its request for diplomatic consultations in January.
The Democratic Party of Korea and the Liberty Korea Party are running too fast toward next year's general elections.
The Democratic Party sparked a discourse on the general election after inauguration of Yang Jung-cheol, the head of the Korea Research Institute for Democracy.
Critics say that the lawmakers are now rushing to the next 21st National Assembly, while suspending the current 20th National Assembly as the animal National Assembly and vegetative National Assembly.
Although a year is left before the end of the 20th National Assembly, both the ruling and main opposition parties focus on next year's general elections and presidential elections held three years later.
The ruling party entered the general election system as the first among the bargaining groups in the National Assembly.
The deliberations on labor-related legislation, such as additional revisions to the budget and the flexible labor system, have been delayed, but may not be held in May.
As North Korea has resumed its show of force with short-range missile launches on the 4th and the 9th, the South Korea government has made its bid for victory under considerable pressure.
The government approved the visit of 193 South Korean businesspeople to inspect Kaesong Industrial Complex's assets, three years and three months after the closure of the complex in February 2016.
The government's direct sending of rice to North Korea and the government's participation in civilian group activities in the North in the form of a "matching fund."
The South Korean government drew the line that the approval of the visit has nothing to do with the resumption of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, but did not deny that the asset inspection was an prelude to a restart.
"It is possible to interpret that (the U.S.) is sending positive signals," said Park Young-sun, minister of Small and Medium-sized Venture Businesses Department, hinting that the department may support the restoration of facilities at the Kaesong Industrial Complex.
Entrepreneurs at the Kaesong Industrial Complex said, "It is regretfully late, but greatly welcome," adding, "A visit should be set up to allow practical inspections to check factories and machinery facilities that have been neglected for more than three years and to set up preservation measures".
The table below is based on the percentage of the total 93 press releases that each newspaper reported on the contents of the Samsung press release.
There were three news reports which the Kynghyang newspaper cited by the exclusive report while monitoring, which was the same number as the Donga daily newspaper which has higher citation rates.
Since Samsung Group is an excellent company, a representative company in Korea, if Samsung press releases are valuable, frequently citing them is not an issue.
The launch of new Samsung Galaxy products which many people use, general shareholder's meetings, performance announcements, and the world's first technology development will be worth the press.
Because there was no further information expect the installation of the billboard, the article only contained a photo marked as "provided by 'Samsung Electronics" and a short description.
Tensions are heightening as Trump's maximum pressure strategy can be met head-on by extreme sanctions.
Hard-liners in the United States seem to be already preparing for that.
There is a slim chance that President Trump will act on the deadline of Chairman of State Affairs Commission Kim Jeong-eun.
One was the appearance of Jang Chang-ha, head of the Defense Science Institute, and Jeon Il-ho, head of the Institute for Automation of Kimchaek University of Technology, at the test-launch site of a short-range missile that Kim Jong-un personally guided, which was the first time since 2017.
In particular, there is a risk that the relationship between the leaders of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Trump may be broken at any time, raising concerns that it could put the entire security of the Korean Peninsula back in a state of extreme tension.
Foreign Affairs predicted that at best, the U.S. Ministry of Finance could announce the suspension of negotiations on denuclearization and improvement of relations, and has a possibility of imposing additional sanctions.
The National Security Adviser Bolton still stresses that the only way to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the Grand Bargain, which agrees on the complete dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear missile programs and the complete lifting of sanctions, and that a complete lifting of the sanctions will be possible only after the complete abandonment.
Two months after the collapse of the second U.S.-North Korea summit in Hanoi, the Secretary of State Kim Jeong-eun has fired a series of short-range missiles, pressuring U.S. President Donald Trump.
It is predicted that President Trump will not renew the atmosphere of armed conflict by vowing "fire and fury" that he had publicly announced in the summer of 2017.
U.S. experts say that North Korean chairman Kim Jong Un or President Trump are too burdensome to reenact the atmosphere of the previous armed conflict and will not do something that will sharply increase the risk of triggering a catastrophe.
Orban is just implementing what Trump has called for.
Now, the world is seeing greater instability, while cooperation among nations has dwindled and the window of opportunity for the United States is closing.
The Trump administration supports whatever they want.
The biggest diplomatic achievement of the United States over the last three decades has turned Mexico into an intimate partner of the United States from an anti-American revolution.
Trump, who lost interest when it became clear that reaching a deal was not easy, has hardly mentioned the issue.
This same pattern appears in a row almost everywhere.
Former principal Park filed a lawsuit against the school board in January 2017 for refusing to apply for the appointment of a principal, but resigned on the 25th of last month after the Supreme Court confirmed the loss.
Kim Yeong-jun, a human rights advocate for student rights (researcher), said, “Many students stated that they spend a large amount of money in addition to tuition fees because of the poor educational environment.”
During a concert in Okinawa, Japan, held under the leadership of the school's head in June last year, there was a student who complained of similar symptoms of heatstroke by having his school perform in winter uniform despite the hot weather.
The school did not allocate teachers or homeroom teachers in some of the subject classes in March, just after the principal's allegations of corruption, so students visited Office of Education and petitioned for guarantee of studying right. he said.
According to the Office of Education, the tuition fee per student during semester of the Seoul Performing Arts Center is 1.23 million won, which is more than three times higher than the average quarterly tuition fee (362,700 won) of public and private high schools except for the autonomous school.

It was a time when Lotte did not make large investments in South Korea, so Chairman Bae judged that there was had no vision.
Chairman Bae said that the social atmosphere that encourages companies and entrepreneurs to "can do" is more important than any other policy means.
CEO Bae's solution is that it is meaningless to focus on increasing sales during the downturn of the construction industry and that the company should increase its profit ratio by receiving proper prices.
Including ready-mixed concrete truck drivers, we have 100,000 employees.
This is a step that requires policy measures to reduce the wage gap between large and small businesses.

It was a waste of time to go home, because there were so many things to learn.
I've heard a lot about job seekers saying that they don't have a job to work for, but it is often heard that people who are looking for people to work saying they don't have anyone to work with.

The Bunam-ho Lake, which was selected by Chungnam-do Province as the site for the project, is also an area where the quality of freshwater lakes has deteriorated to level VI, as is the case with the Veerse Meer.
Due to the odor in the Damsoo Lake, domestic and foreign companies are avoiding investment in Tae-an Enterprise City and Seosan Wellness Zone, and nearby rice fields are subject to drought and salt damage every year.
The province plans to change the structure of the seawall in Bunam Lake and expand the water distribution zone so that the mudflats can be revealed and a brackish water zone can be created.
Attention is focusing on whether the Bunam Lake in Seosan, Chungcheongnam-do Province, which is suffering from worsening water quality and drought and salt damage, can be normalized based on the Netherlands' successful Reverse "Reclamation Project."
Since the Great Flood took place in January 1953, the Netherlands has carried out a 'Delta Project' to build dams, breakwaters and tsunami barriers in 13 delta areas.
Therefore, it is not only unable to use freshwater lakes as agricultural water, but also causing damage to nearby fishing grounds in the rainy season, including Cheonsuman pollution.
It was originally constructed to prevent disasters, tidal waves, fresh water, recreation, and sightseeing, but the sea and river flows were blocked for 40 years and the tidal flats were destroyed, and nutrients from the upper stream were lost. Crustaceans and shellfish have disappeared.
The grandmother was often haunted by auditory and visual hallucination that her son seemed to have visited.
"That grandmother, if she goes to her son's house, comes back after three days," said Ms. Ok-sil in the opposite room, gazing at the back of the two.
She received a third grade rating for long-term care insurance due to her uncomfortable legs, but she was an excellent grandmother in cognitive skills.
Just as the five daughters-in-law took care of Grandmother Ok-sun for two to three years before entering, they also decided that the house where her grandmother would be staying for the holidays was decided by turn.
The second daughter, who works at the office, was in the midst of her working.
The problem is that an old woman, Hye-ja, no longer remembers them.
I lay on half the bed that my grandmother allowed me for a moment, pretending to be her granddaughter-in-law.
Sook-hee grandmother beckoned to a reporter at the end of the day.
"Please call my second daughter, Suk-ja (pseudonym) please," said grandma Ok-hee one day handing a phone to the reporter. She had been looking the entire morning at a phone that never rang once.
Most older people put only one piece of the family picture at their bedside, but Hee-sook brought a massive album to the care home.
The reporter tried to recharge, but the people in nursing home stopped him.
Although he is old, he is nicknamed after caring for the elderly and caregivers.
Every time their families come, they must open the firmly locked iron gates and collect the scarce guardian chairs by running across from one room to another.
It was the first and last day that grandmother Suk-hee showed her feelings.
The living room where Sun-hye escaped to was so cold that she felt chill.
When my grandson or granddaughter has visited, I had to take out some toys.
Just before the call was made to the voicemail, the second daughter answered the phone.
So, today four older men repeated drowsing and waking up in front of the television.
"Grandmother Sook-hee, today is the day that the "National Singing Contest" is on, so don't just watch what you always see..." Before even finishing talking, the grandmother shouted again.
"Don't help me, unless you're going to continue helping me," Grandmother Ok-sil, who stood up to go to the bathroom, shook off the reporter's hand with a grave look.
“How is she always so negative and on-edge about everthing, no wonder her son doesn't come to visit." Whenever grandmother Suk-hee became irritated, the nurses at the nursing home consoled their displeasure by talking behind her back.
Usually, the smell of it made me despair, but not at this time.
There were 8 photos filled on both sides of the album.
More than 10 extended family members, including sons and daughters, daughter-in-law, grandson and granddaughter, came to visit, and the family of Nam Jun grandmother was sitting around a bed and talking.
Experts say the relocation of old-age residences is a major stress for the elderly, it is said they get a considerable shock, especially if the new residence is a facility.
It was only then that I could see why Mrs. Sook-hee had the television all to herself, intervened in every business in the nursing home, and treated people coldly.
Suk-hee, who is a beneficiary of national basic livelihood and receives all of the medical care expenses from the nation, is usually expressionless when elderly people brag about their families, including their children, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren.
48.2% (2,093 patients) of the total 4,344 patients drove for more than 30 minutes a day, and especially 0.9% (38 patients) of the total patients were professional drivers.
Professor Kim Hyun-jik stressed, "Screening tests of professional drivers must also be conducted in South Korea and that follow-up tests or proper treatment should be recommended to patients based on the results."
In particular, daytime sleepiness, another symptom of sleep apnea, is a risk for direct drivers, such as taxi bus railway engineers and aircraft pilots, that can lead to large casualties.
Sleep apnea is a case in which a person stops breathing more than 10 seconds and 15 times per hour while sleeping, or has symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, which is more than 5 times per hour.
About a third of Korean professional drivers are suffering from excessive daytime sleepiness, which critics say is urgent.

Lee Man-hee, a spokesperson for the party, also said on the 19th, "Even though Cheong Wa Dae has a real responsibility for delaying the launch of the fact-finding committee, passing on the responsibility to the opposition party is the political offensive."
"In the case of the Fact Finding Committee, the Liberty Korea Party has already recommended members who are fully qualified, but the Blue House rejected it without reason," floor leader Na pointed out.
The ruling camp attacked the Liberty Korea Party's perception of history, citing its disparaging remarks on May 18 and disciplinary action on those involved, while the Liberty Korean Party counterattacked the ruling camp for using May 18 to create conflict and division.
President Moon will protest, in his May 18 commemoration speech, against the remarks, "May 18 cannot be viewed differently unless he is a descendant of a dictator."

On the 18th(local time), the U.S. broadcasting company, CNN, cited an Irish government official saying, "The White House is insisting that Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar come to President Trump's golf course in Doonbeg."
An Irish diplomatic source told CNN, "Because President Trump is not popular at all in Ireland, his visit has already made a very tricky political issue for the Prim Minister Burrardker."
Ireland has expressed their disapproval as U.S. President Donald Trump pushed for a visit to Ireland early next month, demanding the summit be held at a golf resort owned by Trump.
President Trump’s will seems to have been reflected in the stubbornness of the White House.
This was the location of the summit meeting when the U.S. President Bush visited.
CNN reported that the White House, instead of agreeing to a compromise, said that President Trump might go to a golf course in Scotland instead of visiting Ireland.
The prices of eight foods that consumers enjoy, including Naengmyeon, Kalguksu, Bibimbap, and Gimbap have risen by up to 8% over the past year according to the survey.
The Korea Consumer Agency announced through the comprehensive price information portal, "True Price," on the 19th that the average price of cold noodles, noodle soup and bibimbap in Seoul was KRW 8,962, KRW 6,923 and KRW 8,731, respectively.
“The prices of grains and meats have risen steeply, and the minimum wage hike has increased labor costs, raising food prices,” Sung Tae Yoon, a professor of economics at Yonsei University, said.
The restaurant business is more sensitive to material and labor cost hikes compared to other industries. Recently, material and labor costs have risen significantly.
"The raw material cost has increased and the labor cost burden has increased, raising prices in February," said a relevant person from famous cold noodle restaurant in Jung-gu, Seoul, on the phone with Kookmin Ilbo on that day.
First of all, the consumption increases due to the “monetary illusion“, which is when the 1,000 won item becomes one won cheaper one thinks the price is cheap and so the possibility to stimulate the price increases.
The continuing debate seems to have something to do with recent low prices.
Inflation is more likely to come from lower-priced consumer goods and daily necessities than real estate.

The guarantee business in question has banks jointly prepare funds amounting to KRW 50 billion to be provided to KODIT and KOTEC, which use the funds as the capital for issuing letters of guarantee amounting to KRW 600 billion to business owners as security.
In particular, the guarantee support of the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund and the Korea Technology Finance Corporation is meaningful as it is concentrated on self-employed people who have difficulty in using financial services such as small business owners or self-employed people whose business has deteriorated.
IBK is a special product that gives up all the business costs and legal costs incurred in the loan process in Industrial Bank of Korea, and only gives a loan while taking only the cost of materials (key interest rate).
Since the end date of the project has been scheduled in 2020, if the guarantees are issued at the same rate as now, the situation will be such that most of the limit will be used up just for the handling performance of Korea Credit Guarantee Fund.
According to IBK Industrial Bank of Korea on the 20th, special loans with 1% ultra-low interest rates that were released on Jan. 31 to support small business owners and self-employed businesses surpassed 1 trillion won in accumulated loans just three months after their release.
In the context of financing based on FinTech and changing from new forms and practices, the authoritative escapism of the Financial Services Commission, the financial authority, is in line with the change of finance.
The Financial Services Commission explained that President Choi had stipulated "Don't over-protocol" and asked Korea financial investment association to cancel all of them.
The Financial Services Commission politely asked the Korea Financial Investment Association to cancel the lining up when it reported to the Financial Services Commission that it had prepared the lining up for Choi's welcome.

With the trade dispute between the U.S. and China expected to go on for a long time, the conditions are such that concerns over the economic slowdown are not easily dissipated.
As the trade conflict between the U.S. and China fails to find a solution and the fluctuation of the global stock market increases, the price of bonds valued as safe assets is increasing.
Some explain that the market expects that the central bank will soon lower the benchmark interest rate.
Analysts say that the decision of the U.S. to suspend high tariffs on imported cars is aimed at using the auto tariff issue as leverage in bilateral negotiations with Japan and the European Union (EU).
It is not possible to rule out the possibility that the United States will routinely pressure the US on trade and bilateral trade issues.
In fact, it is worrisome that the U.S. asked Korean carmakers for information on the value chain of parts in the name of an investigation to apply Article 232 of the Trade Expansion Act.
As the U.S. delayed its decision to impose a 25% tariff on imported cars and parts to six months later, for now, the Korean auto industry can take a breath.
In order to prevent the loss of competitiveness of Korean cars, over which there is already a great concern, a more careful response of private-public partnerships to prepare for the routinization of trade friction is needed.
In preparation for the failure to handle it in May, it is said that the Democratic Party is also considering a plan to temporarily delay the terms of the current accounting committee members until the handling of the extra budget.
It was pushed forward when floor leader Oh made a proposal for floor leader Lee to be a "brother who buys beer well" during a courtesy visit for his inauguration on the 16th.
Park Chan-dae, floor spokesman of the Democratic Party, said, "Floor leader Lee and floor leader Oh originally proposed a meeting in the evening of the 19th, but floor leader Na counter-proposed a meeting on the 20th."
With a meeting of floor leaders of the three negotiating groups confirmed, some observers say that some progress may be made on handling key issues such as the convening of an extraordinary parliamentary session in May and the supplementary budget.
The Democratic Party of Korea and the Liberty Korea Party are still disagreeing in each other on precondition for the normalization of the National Assembly, but there are also observations that there will be progress in discussing the convening of the extraordinary National Assembly in May as floor leaders from three parties meet for the first time.
Earlier, floor leader Na also said that she would become a "pretty sister who buys a meal well" to floor leader Lee, and the meeting took place.
Lee Gye-sung, a spokesman for the National Assembly, said, “We will make a meeting for the five-party representatives after seeing the results of the three-party representatives in a pub.”
The Liberty Korea Party says the Democratic Party of Korea should provide a justification for its return to the National Assembly.
The British far-right politicians doing street campaigns are suffering from milkshake baptism.
The British police appeared to be concerned about a milkshake throwing during the campaign.

In other words, there will be no problem even if the government releases more funds to the private sector.
President Moon Jae-in made a significant statement at the National Financial Strategy Meeting on the 16th.
The key point is that “the drastic role of finance is more important than ever” to solve the structural problems and short-term economic response of our society.

It is necessary to revise family institutions and norms according to the changed social situation.
Song Kil-young, a big data expert, diagnoses that the rising sense of gender equality and a large number of single-person households have created a trend that can no longer force the existing Normal Family to society as a whole.
As the case of Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the collapse of the social safety net is a pathological phenomenon, the population decline flows in an undesirable direction.
At the end, there is a conversation with Yoo Si-min, a writer on February 15, 2002, which is after he declared his run for president.
At the beginning of his collection, Writer Yoo wrote, who is also the chairman of Roh Moo-hyun Foundation wrote that, " (The former president Roh) he had a big responsibility in the performance of official duties but enough to be humble and informal as unusual for a human being."
"Honey, Help Me" (1st), "Roh Moo-hyun's Leadership Story" (2nd) "Success and Frustration" (3rd), "Future of Progress" (4th), and "It is Fate" (5th) is a new edition of the published book.
Before the tenth anniversary of former President Roh Moo-hyun's death (coming 23rd), books of his life and philosophy are pouring out in the bookstore.
The preface was written by director Yoon Tae-young, a director of Roh Moo-hyun Foundation, who served as secretary of the participatory government.
It is expected that if North Korea accepts the visit of personnel of South Korean companies to North Korea, who operated in the Kaesong Industrial Complex, inter-Korean dialogue and North Korea-the U.S. dialogue could secure momentum again, and it could coincide with President Trump's visit to South Korea.
Some speculate that the North Korea may refuse to visit the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a South Korean company, if there was not enough prior communication between the two Koreas.
The government explained that the visit has been approved to protect the property rights of South Koreans, and that a visual inspection of various assets will be conducted.
It is still unknown whether North Korea will accept the letter of invitation from us.
Whether the live-in businessman at the Kaesong Industrial Complex will be able to visit the North or not is expected to be a barometer in reading the North's intention to resume dialogue.
With U.S. President Donald Trump set to visit South Korea in late June, the situation on the Korean Peninsula is expected to fluctuate depending on the North Korea's response.
The South Korean government appears to have taken out a specific card to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table amid concerns that the strained inter-Korean and North Korea-the U.S. dialogue could be prolonged due to the North's provocation of missile launches.
I rarely get involved as a Member of Parliament unless it is a special case (e.g., if I have two applicants who are difficult to distinguish between the two and ask for my opinion).
If things go well, you can get a promotion and work in a new congressman's office.
It's not that they don't get along or don't have a heart-to-heart talk with each other.
Secondly, there are aides who specialize in a particular standing committee.
The increased workload and professionalism of the National Assembly have made the role of aides important.
In that regard, the parliamentary office is not much different from other jobs.
Other members include employees of the Secretariat of the National Assembly, those working for political parties, and the aid staff.
We need someone to help us decide where to run and even if we get an office.
The steady increase in the number of aides in past parliaments despite various criticisms is not simply because lawmakers wanted to be treated or comfortable.
In that case, it is to visit candidate with a good chance of winning and who they feel like working together and help him win the election.
Among the routes to become aides to the lawmaker's office, it is most common that they naturally end up working together after helping with their campaigns like this.
What the boss does is not uncommon in our society, which is dominated by a work culture that must be followed unconditionally, but it must be changed.
They sometimes have to suffer from the weight of lawmakers who are not polite or caring, and sometimes have to face disadvantages because they are mobilized for bad things.
For example, they may have been interns for a long time and were recognized for their abilities but could not be promoted due to the lack of retirement staff.
The latest example is that aides of Liberty Korea Party, who had to work on blocking the bill from accepting it during the fast-track process, were accused of violating the National Assembly Act.
Each is a complex set of interests and long disputed ones.
In the process of revising the election law, it is said that if the number of lawmakers increases, the number of aides will be reduced, but I think it would be difficult to say so if they knew how much they work in the lawmakers' offices.
A man who does not know whether he is a doctor or a soldier consoled with unsympathetic words, "It is a time of going to the moon, so it is just fine without an eye."
I want young people to learn about this history and visit the May 18th National Cemetery for once.
When I returned from the army and prepared to go back to school, the Gwangju massacre happened in Gwangju.
On the street, people from the city were carrying corpses into their cars.
I was worried, but my phone and mode of communication got cut off, so there was no way to contact them.
On the 26th day when the martial law was terminated, I sent my son out and got insulted.
When I came out of the house, the streets were already covered with airborne forces.
At first, he said, "5/18 was not a big protest."
The night before, it was said that "the martial law army will come in tomorrow, so those who want to survive should leave here," but Park Chun-man decided to stay until the end and released the safety pins on the gun.
I heard that there was a fire on the Gwangju MBC broadcasting station at dawn.
I could guess the extent to which "something happened in my hometown of Gwangju" by hearing rumors circulating in the unit.
I had no money to go to college, so I postponed my entrance for a year.
I was scared, but when I saw martial armies battling the citizens, I was very furious.
It was later when I learned that my little brother/sister was dead.
I think it is very unfortunate historically to have killed an elderly people or young children who did not participate in the demonstration like my father.
On May 21, 1980, when the martial law army began firing collectively, Kim, who was 15 years old at the time, was shot in his neck and died on his way to Geumnam-ro to search for his mother.
A photo taken after the martial law forces seized the provincial government building showed Ahn, dressed in a High school drill uniform, lying face down and sprawled out, portraying the tragedy at the time.
Even though all elementary, middle and high schools in Gwangju were closed on May 19, Ahn joined a group of students pouring into the city center.
He, who climbed onto a truck driven by citizens and pretested on May 21, was shot by martial law army in front of the South Jeolla Provincial Government and was hurriedly moved to a Christian hospital, but died soon after.
After Ahn returned home on the 21st, and the martial law forces withdrew to the outskirts, his mother tried to stop him unsuccessfully by putting his shoes in the trash can and soaking his clothes in water.
Foreign media cameras showed the then-five-year-old son holding the portrait of the deceased Cho, who was placed in a commercial hall in front of the South Jeolla provincial government.
Right after the thirty-ninth anniversary of the May 18 Democratic Movement, President Moon Jae-in visited the toms of patriotic martyr (late) Kim Wan-bong, Cho Sa-cheon, and Ahn Jong-pil, which draws attention to these victims.
Cho, who works in the construction business, witnessed students getting beaten up by air transportation troopers in front of the main gate of Gwangju National University of Education on May 20 on his way home to help his wife's farm work, and after getting hit while pulling them apart, decided to take part in the demonstration.
At the ceremony, more than 5,000 people, including President Moon Jae-in and the opposition party's four-party leadership, attended to commemorate the spirits that fell under the gun knife of the Chun Doo-hwan's army on May 1980.
At the ceremony, Park Yeong-seon, who had aired the last broadcast when martial law army entered the Jeonnam Provincial Office Building at the dawn of May 27, 1980, came on the stage and recreated the voice of that day in May.
In his commemorative speech, President Moon bowed his head, saying, "I am really sorry for not being able to be together when Gwangju was bleeding and dying in May 1980, as one of the citizens who lived the era."
After the ceremony, President Moon and first lady Kim Jeong-suk toured the cemetery where the spirit of May was buried and comforted the families of the victims.
President Moon was briefly shown not being able to control his emotions when An Hye-jin, a nephew of An Jong-myeong (then a freshman at Dongseong High School in Gwangju) who died by the bullet of the martial law army at the provincial office building on the 27th, came on the stage and introduced the sad story of the family,
Just as you talk in a noisy downtown area and then enter a noise-free recording studio to talk again, your brain plays back the information acquired during the day, taking advantage of the quietness during the slow-wave sleep.
Infants and adolescents with their brains growing should be more careful.
In the early stages of sleep, there is a high percentage of deep sleep (non-REM sleep or slow wave sleep), and in the later period, shallow sleep (REM sleep) accounts for the greater part.
This is why adolescents' sleep time, unlike adults, has become set to sleeping late and waking up late.
Except for a few who are born with these abilities, the average person needs to sleep for at least seven to eight hours a day for normal cognitive functioning.
Early scholars thought that sleep keeps merely the memory well by protecting the learned information from being interrupted by other information.
Repeated NREM and REM are called ”sleep cycles,” and when a person wakes up after evenly repeated sleep cycles, it makes him/her feel like ”well slept.”
In the next stage, the brain waves gradually become active, similar to the awakening state, but the muscles remain stationary, which marks the state of REM sleep.
Considering that the stage of sleep that has an important effect on memory is a deep sleep, one can see how important it is to sleep well for the first four hours.
Considering other studies that lack of sleep is also associated with brain diseases such as dementia, it seems clear that insufficient sleep is not good for the brain's memory function.
Usually, when an adult falls asleep, he or she quickly enters a deep sleep status and repeats REM sleep and non-REM sleep every 90 minutes for the first 4 hours.
Especially during early childhood, the changes in chemicals in the brain are different from adults.
According to data from five high schools that revealed the results of entrance exams at Ewha Womans University, a total of 222 students were accepted. Sookmyung Girls' High School produced the most successful applicants with 80, followed by Seomun Girls' High School with 51 and Jinseon Girls' High School with 41.
In the case of those who passed the exam at Chung-Ang University, Hwimun Girls' High School had the largest number of students with 70 people, 48 at Sookmyung Girls' High School, 44 at Dankook University High School, 40 at Hyundai High School, 33 at Chungang University High School, 32 at Seomun Girls' High School, 30 at Sangmoon High School, 20 at Jinseon Girls' High School and 14 at Dongduk Girls' High School, etc.
Examining 6 high schools' results of admission examination to medical schools, which had been released with the number of admitted students at each irregular and regular selection, there were more admitted students through regular selection with 60.4% than those through irregular selection with 39.6%.
Seoul National University's entrance examination by high school is a meaningful indicator of the occasional competitiveness of high schools in the college entrance system with a high proportion of occasional students.
Considering that the published data is the number of successful applicants including graduates who re-challenge on-time for medical school entrance examinations, we know that attending students are also showing considerable results even at early admission.
Kuroda Haruhiko, governor of the Bank of Japan, said last month that the (MMT) cannot be accepted because it is an extreme claim that does not take into account fiscal deficits.
The Asahi Shimbun also sarcastically said that "since Japan was pointed out as a testing ground for the Heretical Economic Theory, the Bank of Japan should start by acknowledging the situation it is also facing."
Argentina, Zimbabwe, and Venezuela, which are reeling from inflation, are typical examples.
If the government prints money indefinitely, hyperinflation (rapid price hikes) could occur and the value of money will be less than the scraps of paper.
A credit crunch could occur and lead to a debt crisis.
This is because Southeast Asia, which had been plagued by only domestic waste, has become saturated with capacity as it has taken over waste that was headed to China after China stopped importing trash from its neighbor.
The Philippine Foreign Minister declared on 1st that Canadian garbage will be shipped in full time, but no return has been made even at 15th.
Of the 103 containers smuggled into the Philippines in 2013-2014, the Canadian government collects 69 containers containing waste, including used diaper.
He said that there are criminal organizations that benefit greatly from importing garbage from advanced countries, and that he will track them to the end and hold them accountable.
It has been discovered that waste disposal companies in developed countries are colluding with recycling plants in Indonesia to trick harmful waste into recyclable waste when carrying in.
According to the New Straits Times and other local media outlets, Malaysian Energy, Science and Technology, Environment and Climate Change Minister Yeo Bee Yin said 129 containers containing non-recycled plastic waste were left unattended at Port Clock Harbor near Kuala Lumpur last month.
That's because that the two sides agreed that the Canadian government take back the garbage that was illegally exported to the Philippines, but it was not going well.
According to the Indonesian environmental activist group Ecothon, Australia exported 52,000 tons of waste paper to East Jawa last year, a 3.5-fold jump from four years ago.
According to Greenpeace Indonesia, the volume of waste imported by Indonesia was about 10,000t per month until the end of 2017, but it increased to over 35,000t per month at the end of 2018.
"With the main characters of "the Theater Game", this season's Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League final, which is the 27th of its kind since the 1992-1993 season, when it was reorganized into a Champions League system."
Marcello Lippi, Alex Ferguson and Carlo Ancelotti (over four times) are the coaches who made the most teams in the Champions League final since 1992-1993.
At the time, AC Milan led 3-0 in the first half of their 26th Champions League final and lost the penalty shootout after allowing Liverpool to tie the score later.
After his second loss, then-defeated manager Diego Simeone expressed the bitterness of defeat by saying, "What is clear is that no one remembers the loser."
"The only one of the four finalists not winning was when he became the scapegoat for the 2005 'Miracle of Istanbul', which was coached by AC Milan."
There is also a team like Juventus who had to swallow the struggle in the final against the defending champions Real Madrid while the final was undefeated.
"The coach who came to the top of the Champions League at his youngest was Pep Guardiola, who led FC Barcelona in 2009 to 38 years and 129 days old."
As a player, Cristiano Ronaldo won the first time in Manchester United (2008) and then won four times in Real Madrid (2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018) recording the most win.
The team won the 2014 playoff with three goals in the second half of the extra time, and only managed to beat its regional rival after a penalty shootout in 2016.
Among them, Ancelotti and Zidane were all three times.
The top place half has also collapsed, making it virtually difficult to do normal party affairs.
The first meeting of the Supreme Council, attended by new floor leader Oh Sin-hwan, has been marred by a dispute between the "party faction" and "retirement faction" over the resignation of the leader Son Hak-gyu.
The so-called "party faction" that supports the leader Son's regime has been on the defensive since the party's floor leader primary due to a reversal of public opinion in the party, which has halved its drive to lead the party.
"The boycott of the three supreme council members was the beginning of abnormalities," and "obstinately speaking, it doesn't look good for the Party or to citizens," he said, targeting the member of the supreme council, Ha Tae-gyeong, Lee Jun-seok and Kwon Eun-hui (from the Bareun Party)
The so-called "retirement faction," which calls for Son's resignation, has drawn public opinion within the party in the race for the new floor leader, but there is no basis (the party regulations and constitutions) to support the party's distrust of the party leader.
Accumulation of intense ultraviolet light reduces the elasticity of the lens and accelerates the progression of cataracts, which appear cloudy as fog, and macular degeneration with curved central view.
Although there is no harm to the human body when it is in low doses, exposure of more than 0.12 ppm of ozone, which is at the advisory level, can irritate the eyes and nose and can lead to frequent coughing accompanied by nausea, indigestion, headaches, and anxiety.
The high concentration of ozone, which was mainly seen in the summer with high temperature and insolation, is a trend that continues until September, due to global warming.
It is recommended that respiratory patients, the elderly, and children stay indoors.
It is also important to drink more than 1ℓ of water a day to supply moisture to the skin so that ozone does not build up.
Mizuho Financial Group, which handled the valuation losses of foreign bonds due to the rise in long-term interest rates (falling bond prices), and lost 695.4 billion yen in such things as processing the cost of developing a computerized system, saw a whopping 83 percent decrease in profits compared to the previous year.
It is pointed out that although efficiency is also improving as Japanese financial holding companies use their digital technologies for their financial services, they are still far behind European and U.S. financial firms.
In particular, overseas branches and corporations of major Japanese banks increased their current expenses by more than 10% in the process of expanding their business scope.
Japanese banks are rushing to slim down their work because of their excessive cost structure compared to the U.S. and Europe.
Japanese banks' digitalization lags behind banks in the U.S. and Europe, and accordingly traditional business models still exist, so there is a growing sense of the problem that huge current charges are being paid.
Banks, which have determined that a significant portion of the working expenses burden lies in the operation of their base stores and ATM devices, are planning to reduce the most of the amount.
While European and U.S. banks account for around 50% of their working expenses in this field, Japan's overseas branches and corporations account for nearly 80% of their working expenses.
Thanks to the good price in the auction market, the profit for the day was not bad.
After work, Naeil checked if her shared car was empty to go shopping, made a reservation and went down to the underground parking lot.
Recently, the term sustainable development is booming again.
As indoor air circulation function is strengthened, higher maintenance costs can be covered from this area.
Seeing her son who says it is better than Korea although it is hard to live abroad, Nae-il also got to feel frustrated.
It seems that it is because of the difficulty to play a full-fledged war with KCGI, as Hanjin family's internal dispute over succession and inheritance has not been resolved.
Kang Seong-bu, CEO of KCGI, has a history of helping major shareholders in the Yojin Construction & Engineering, a construction firm of middle standing, which had previously suffered from inheritance tax problems, and of realizing profits.
It's a situation of although HANJIN KAL's stocks are a safe collateral, other investment banks are also reluctant to offer loans collateralized with stocks to KCGI in consideration of their relationship with Hanjin Group, the official said.
Even if the wife of the late Cho, Lee Myung-hee and their three children inherit stake under general inheritance standards, it is difficult to surpass KCGI's dominance if there is disagreement among them.
There is a possibility that Hanjin KAL will introduce a consecutive terms of its executive director, Cho Won-tae, at next year's shareholders' meeting, and that KCGI may present a shareholder proposal that is unfavorable to the family of its owners due to its increased efficiency in management.
Since Trump's inauguration, the scope of regulation has expanded, and Chinese students have even been banned from studying specific skills in the United States.
Amid the trade war between the U.S. and China, calls have been raised in China for both the U.S. and China to maintain active cooperative relations rather than hostile strategies to become winners.
The newspaper defined rebalancing as "a process in which both sides simultaneously promote structural reform" and pointed out that the U.S. should reduce consumption and China should increase internal demand.
The newspaper expressed concern that although the U.S. introduced a separation policy to win the competition with China, the choice would pose enormous risks for both countries.
"The U.S. has long been concerned about the use of huge surpluses earned from its competitors," and "They naturally think that if there is a trade surplus, U.S. bonds should be bought," the paper pointed out.
During the Obama administration, the U.S. adopted a "weak separation" strategy to establish a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which excluded China and secured a trade advantage by allowing Chinese manufacturing companies to move to TPP member countries.
WellStory is a company that is 100% owned by Samsung C&T, whose family members, including Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong, hold more than 30% of shares.
Civic groups earlier raised suspicions that Hyundai Glovis and Sampyo were engaged in so-called "taking in transit taxes" that they receive commissions while not playing a substantial role in Hyundai Steel's delivery business of raw materials.
The Korea Fair Trade Commission is reportedly verifying whether the Hyundai Motor Group is carrying out improper internal transactions, such as giving driving automobile product shipments to Hyundai Glovis in a lump sum.
The Fair Trade Commission has launched an on-site investigation into Hyundai Motor Group's alleged unfair support of Hyundai Glovis Co., an affiliate of Hyundai Motor Group, and Sampyo, an in-law company.
Its chief executive Chung Eui-sun, the largest shareholder, owns 23.29% of the shares, but the combined shares of Chung Mong-koo are less than 30%, so Hyundai Glovis is not subject to the regulation on the acquisition of private interests of the president's family.
It is unlikely that Representative Sohn will retire before September.
Professor Kim is not currently in Germany with the former leader An, and the scenario of his return to politics with the end of the sabbatical seems somewhat contrived.
It seems that the the former representative Ahn did not decide on a specific course of action.
The former leader An reportedly established representative Lee as the party's floor leader as he retreated from the political front after a series of defeats, including the 2017 presidential election and the 2018 local elections.
However, considering the former leader An's will to see the "multiple party system to break down the vested interests of two-party politics" and "reform" as the "right way", it is highly likely that he approved the "designation of election law on the fast track".
As the former leader An stepped down from politics to take responsibility for the defeat in the election, the minimum cause for his return is the "call of members of the Party."
During the process, Lee Tae-kyu, who met with Ahn on a trip to Germany, reportedly delivered Ahn's behind strategies.
Even after getting married, she made a living by sewing and weaving with her mother, and lived with her husband only three years later.
I turned 20 and married Yoon Kwang-yung who is 6 years younger living in Chungjy, but his family members were living scattered because they didn't have a place to live.
Then one day, Jeong Il-dang’s role as an “assistant” for her husband gets upgraded to being his "teacher”, in which she jumped into the field of academics by her own will to become a holy person.
Unlike the self-sufficiency enjoyed in the world of ideas, Jeong Il Dang's Neo-Confucianism, which was established through labor, puts a strong emphasis on everyday practice.
In times when poverty was common, there can't be enough students and works.
In fact, this data is cited as Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport, but it was obtained early last year by the Korea Association of Bus Transport Associations through the request of service business at The Korea Transport Institute.
This official said, "If it is a 200 won, which will be raised by Gyeonggi Province, there will be no difficulty in paying increased amount of the existing bus driver and paying salary for new drivers."
Critics point out that the government may be making too easy a judgment.
The government and the bus industry are divided in this regard, creating anxiety.
This is the cause of inconvenience to the passengers of the bus.
However, since the results of the service were based on the situation at the beginning of last year, it was acknowledged that there was a limit that could not reflect the line adjustment made after the service.
Otherwise, measures such as route adjustments and limits on the number of trips will be inevitable.
It is made up of basic data by bus operators to respond to the 52-hour workweek.
As for the fare increase, it is said that a KRW 400 increase is necessary to fill the driver properly.
The first stage of Bitcoin development was dealt with by criminals and a handful of early adopters, while the second stage was when Bitcoin proved its commercial potential due to the price bubble and was bombarded with speculators and swindlers seeking to get-rich-quick.
The reason why U.S. SEC did not approve bitcoin ETF was because of the lack of trust due to continuous issues within the digital asset industry, such as price manipulation, cross trading, and hacking.
Indeed, Bakkt's vision is that bitcoin is included in the retirement pension of the Millennial generation, which may one day have the day to include bitcoin in the national pension fund's portfolio.
The SEC is likely to approve the request if the ETF, a bitcoin based on transparent bitcoin price information provided by ICE's Bakkt and Nasdaq, the world's largest bourse.
The problem is that CME and Cboe's Bitcoin futures trading is a cash payment method.
Lee Dong-ju, a senior researcher at the Korea Small Business Institute, pointed out that "Cooperatives in small and medium enterprise cooperatives are often viewed as associations rather than collaborative organizations, and there is a lack of overall support for revitalizing medium-term cooperatives."
It is pointed out that there is a need for realistic revitalization measures along with internal innovation of SME cooperatives.
Kim Gi-mun, chairman of the Korea Federation of Small and Medium-sized Businesses, stressed, “The government has established a plan for activation but it has not been properly implemented, now an ecosystem should be created that can enhance the union's self-sustaining power."
As the group voluntary contract system was implemented, the SMEs relied on voluntary contracts, which led to problems such as the lack of competitiveness and the improper allocation of contract volume.
This is because the existing proceeds business is disadvantageous and there is no progress in the discovering of new species of business models.
This policy is designed to secure a stable market for products produced by small and medium-sized businesses.
North Korean State Councilor Kim Jong-un, who returned home empty-handed from the second North Korea-the U.S. summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, is widely believed to be unlikely to actively respond to the South Korean government's plan without any progressive proposal from the U.S.
North Korea is deepening the depth of distrust after the U.S. administration seized the North Korean freighter "Wise Ernest" on the 14th on charges of violating sanctions on the North, denouncing it as an "act of highway robbery".
"Basically, there will be discussions on the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," presidential spokesman Ko Min-jung said. "We will also share various information on the situation that the two countries have."
It is also interpreted that the announcement of the Korea-US summit meeting without a specific schedule agreed is to give North Korea a time to prepare.
It is reported that President Trump's visit to Seoul is considered a one-day trip or a two-day visit due to his tight schedule.
If North Korea is put on a dialogue track for the remaining one month until the Group of 20 (G20) nations summit at the end of the next month, the denuclearization negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea could take a radical turn.
The picture book "Rubinstein is So Pretty" features Rubinstein with jewel-like eyes, a sculpted nose and elegant hands.
I glanced at the children who didn't look rude in the light of the old days.
Probably being in a good mood, the child ran around humming.
It's not a good idea to ask why it looks like a pimple.
I had a bitter smile on oblivion that works conveniently depending on situations.
Japan, an ultra-aged society, has started to revise a law aimed at increasing the retirement age from 65 to 70 years old to help ease labor shortages.
According to Japan's 2018 population statistics, 35.57 million people, or 28.1 percent, are aged 65 or older out of the total population of 126.42 million.
For the Japanese government, the labor shortage is a major problem due to a decrease in the number of production-age problem.
The Japanese government has finalized a revision to the Employment Stabilization Act for the Elderly, which would allow workers to work up to 70 if they wanted to, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported on the 16th.
The Japanese government will take the second-phase approach of extending the retirement age to 70 in the coming years, with companies obliged to try to have senior citizens get a job opportunity, the Yomiuri Shimbun predicted.
That is, this law provides the legal basis for the employment policy for senior citizens.
If the employment stabilization law for the elderly is revised, the total number of employed people will be increased by 2.17 million when the employment rate for those aged 65 to 69 is the same as the current 60 to 64.
At the same time, a wage peak system was introduced, which peaks at the age of 55.
Naval unmanned helicopters have many advantages over standard drones.
Although the fact that the price is over 15 billion won is burdensome, the combined capability of manned and unmanned helicopter operation and unmanned helicopters with striking power are expected to double the navy ship's surveillance, reconnaissance and emergency attack capabilities.
The maritime drone battle of three countries, South Korea, China, and Japan, are opening.
The reason why the Navy chose the model, which caused casualties, is that it is actually the world standard thanks to its good performance compared to its price.
In ships with narrow space, there is a high possibility of failure or breakage as injecting a catapult and retrieving net are the only ways.
"But the problem is that the policy tools that we have to be used to fight the deficit don't work," Intelligencer pointed out.
Apart from the monetary effect, a worsening economic outlook will reduce Chinese consumers' demand for the U.S. exports or domestic products.
President Trump recommended a figure who would faithfully follow his demands to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, but failed to convince the Republicans, the majority.
Rather than asking France to buy more U.S. goods, making such a demand in China has some effect.
President Trump also seems to understand the need for monetary policy.
"So President Trump's imposition of trade pressure on China at a time when China's economy is slowing down due to various factors does not help the U.S. reduce its deficit," Intelligencer pointed out.
This means more Chinese goods are coming to the export market.
Ben Bernanke, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, had pointed out a few years ago that "global excessive savings" is creating a trade deficit that led to widespread unemployment in the United States.
The New York Daily's "Intelligencer" noted on the 16th, saying that "But if you go deeper, Trump's thoughts might not be accurate but aren't exactly nonsense."
This means that Chinese goods will be cheaper for US buyers, while US goods will be more expensive for Chinese buyers.
There is much criticism that President Trump for trying to take over the Fed.
Former Defense Minister Kim Tae-young (currently President of the Korean War Memorial Foundation) meets with a reporter from Media Today for press coverage in front of the entrance to the Seoul High Court on the 16th.
Former Defense Minister Kim Tae-young is at the National Defense Committee's general meeting held at the National Assembly in the afternoon on March 29, 2010, explaining underwater conditions by presenting photographs of underwater in the area of the ROKS Cheonan sinking incident by different water levels.
It was the response from former Defense Minister Kim Tae-young to the press inquiry suggesting him to resolve the doubt by re-investigating the ROKS Cheonan sinking incident and disclosing any undisclosed documents.
Shortly after the sinking of the ship and the killing of 46 soldiers, he/she has been called to the presidential office and the National Assembly for a day from the day after the accident, reporting the Cheonan incident or revealing his judgment.
The Defense Ministry even speculated that the return of some small submarines that disappeared from North Korean naval bases after leaving the base two to three days later had nothing to do with the Cheonan incident, but later attacked the Cheonan.
Recently, there has been a dispute with China over the sovereignty of Koryo ginseng.
For this reason, Korean ginseng has long been rare and expensive.
It is known that Korean ginseng contributed greatly to independence during the Japanese occupation.
According to a paper written by Kim Gwang-je, the National History Compilation Committee 's research paper, “Activities of Shanghai Korean Ginseng Traders under Japanese imperialism”, Korean red ginseng has the same function as the international currency like dollar today.
There were many ginseng shops in Shanghai, including Lee Yu-seon's Jiseong Corporations, Han Jin-gyo's Haesong-yanghaeng, Kim Si-mun's Golden Gate Corporations, Cho Seong-seop's Wonchang Corporations and Kim Hong-seo's Samseong Corporations.
Haesong Yang-haeng supported a large number of travel expenses when Kim Gyu-sik went to France to attend the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, and also supported expenses when Ahn Chang-ho went to Hong Kong, Beijing and other cities in 1920 to meet with a group of U.S. lawmakers.
AFP reported that when asked about the possibility of dialogue with the U.S. at a meeting with reporters during his visit to Japan, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif dismissed it by saying, "There is no possibility whatsoever."
According to administration officials, Aide Bolton recently complained that President Trump has no will to change the messed up circumstances in the Middle East.
Aide Bolton's plan to change the Venezuelan regime has become even less likely to be achieved as the military uprising to oust President Nicolas Maduro has failed.
President Trump believes he has made the achievement of bringing North Korean leader Kim Jeong-eun to the dialogue table by pressing hard on North Korea.
Reports have been pouring in that President Trump and White House National Security Adviser John Bolton differ widely in their perception of approach toward Iran.
Reportedly, President Trump had the idea of applying the methodology to Iran in his mind, but he is being perplexed when Bolton goes too far by calling for military options.
President Trump dismissed as "fake news" a Washington Post report that he is unhappy with Adviser Bolton and Minister Pompeo.
President Trump's strong push for the other side is to gain favorable results in the negotiations, not to consider using military force to neutralize it.
On the same day, Bloomberg reported that it was worried about President Trump made an armed conflict with Iran ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
Regarding the evaluation of the intelligence that Iran will attack US troops in the Middle East, considerable disagreement has been reported among Trump administration officials.
In particular, fierce debates have arisen among officials over his plans to send US troops to Iran based on this photo and to order a partial withdrawal from the US Embassy in Iraq.
The New York Times (NYT) reported on the 16th that President Trump expressed that he had "no intention to wage war with Iran" during a meeting with Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on the 15th (local time).
NYT reported that aide Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo considered the photo a sign of Iran's attempt to attack U.S. forces, and the aircraft carrier fleet and strategic bombers were dispatched to the Middle East as a result.
Some personnel of the White House are skeptical about aide Bolton, and some are even saying that his position may have been compromised.
Bloomberg reported by quoting a military official that the vessel in question is a modified version of the Middle East's traditional sailboat, dhow, and is designed to launch missiles directly from the ship at targets on the ground.
One victim testified that martial law forces stormed into a civilian house that did not participate in the demonstration at the time and sexually assaulted her with her mother.
According to Heo, the airborne unit at the time marked the location of the body's burial with coordinates on the map, and re-discovered the buried body at the order of the security guard to examine the fingerprints, and some were incinerated at Gwangju Unified Hospital.
According to some reports, the military's third-class secret document called "The Suppression and the Lessons Learned" contains a record of the 'corpse' being moved by air force aircraft during the May 18 period.
Chun Doo-hwan has always denied visiting Gwangju during the period of 5.18.
There are still many missing people whose bodies or bones have not been found.
The document lists the status of the Air Force's support for transport aircraft at the time of May 18, titled "Airlift Support (air transport)," where "dead body" is written next to the transport record of "Gimhae to Gwangju".
Rev. Lee Gyeong-nam, who belonged to the 11th Air Cavalry Brigade and was deployed to Gwangju on May 19, 1980, testified that "they suddenly shortened curfew on May 19, and there were many sexual assaults by martial law army that day."
"The massive shooting at citizens of Gwangju took place immediately after the meeting," Kim said, adding that "Jeon Du-hwan is believed to have ordered the shooting at the meeting."
Kim testified that "the 40 reports posted to the U.S. Department of Defense also included 'the content that then-Secretary-General Jeon Du-hwan arrived in the Gwangju 1st Fighter Squadron on May 21, 1980 by helicopter.'"
Among the testimonies, it is noteworthy that "the arson, shooting, and extortion of armored vehicles allegedly committed by North Korean Special Forces at that time were most likely that the convenience forces induced citizens' actions or conducted them directly."
According to a Korean Retirement and Income Study, middle and high-aged people in their 50s and older in Korea think that the proper cost of living for old age is 2.43 million won per month based on couples.
The figure is very high, given that the average national household for home ownership is around 55%.
If retirees don't sell their house or move to a smaller house to cover living expenses, many of them will struggle living below the poverty line.
The reason why it is difficult to secure living expenses after retirement is simple.
Some may ask where the cost of living is the right answer.
In fact, there is not much money that they can secure.
Now, we need to hear the voices of individual retirees.
This is because most of their assets are focused on real estate.
"If expansionary fiscal policy is repeated for a long period of time with the aim of boosting the economy in the short term, it will likely result in mid- to long-term financial burden," researcher Kwon said.
He pointed out that the expansionary fiscal policy of boosting the economy by releasing the country's money is only a "short-term measure" and cannot solve the structural problem of falling productivity.
It means invisible factors such as technology, education, systems and resource allocation systems have had an impact on output growth, a gauge of how efficiently the economy operates.
"The Korean economy still has plenty of room to achieve productivity gains by improving institutional factors such as legislation and property rights protection and regulations on financial, labor and business activities," he said.
The efficiency of the Korean economy is falling that much.
First of all, as the global economy is slowly recovering after the global financial crisis, productivity indicators of Korean economy which is highly dependent on foreign market were also sluggish.
Researcher Kwon stressed that the Korean economy should focus on improving productivity as it cannot expect a quick recovery of the global economy.
Recognizing these problems, 69% of workers said they need an automatic investment system (default option) that allows them to select and invest in the operation of retirement pensions and the selection of products instead of subscribers.
The Korea Financial Investment Association's simple calculation of the return on the introduction of default options through the U.S. and Australian cases showed a 6.4%p of annual difference.
Subscribers are required to change their asset allocation strategies depending on market conditions, but they are not able to give instructions on operation in time due to their low expertise and indifference.
From the corporate's point of view, a person in charge of personnel management generally takes charge of retirement pensions as part of their work, so they are not paying much attention to their returns.
Fund-type governance is a system in which labor and management establish a governance structure (entrusting corporate body) to manage the retirement pension, and operate the retirement pension according to the decision of the governance structure.
The return rate was that high when the default option was applied.
However, the default option is responsible for loss.
He tracks how words like people, citizens, nation and democracy, were arranged and changed in the post-war era, through the main thoughts of the thinkers of the present age.
He took issue with the consciousness of the people and control of the media during the war, noting that there are no individuals in Japan with free self-reliance consciousness.
It said that the "system of irresponsibility" was in control, as the people were not the principal agents, so they had no sense of responsibility, and even power holders thoughtlessly followed the instructions or corrupted.
It was the accusation of the absence of such a modern individual when he said, "In our country, modern thinking is not really acquired, far from "conquered"."
His motive for writing this massive work was that the postwar ideology became more and more conservatively inclined to conservative nationalism in numerous misunderstandings.
Since Japan exported its war supplies and revived the economy with the outbreak of the Korean War, it enters into the "second postwar phase" as it regains its pre-war status.
He/she looks forward to seeing Lebanon overcoming difficulties and regaining its reputation of the old days.
The largest remaining temple in Baalbek, the Jupiter Temple, originally had 54 columns, but now only six remain due to several earthquakes and looting.
When one thinks about Lebanon the image of a country that has suffered many trials and hardships due to civil war and war for a long time, and recently, a dangerous country as an aftermath of Syria's civil war, comes to mind.
Lebanon has suffered a lot from a 15-year civil war, the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, and the 2006 war with Israel, and there are still traces of bullets and shells all over Beirut.
In Lebanon, these splendid historical sites are remained in the whole area.
The southern cities of Tyre and Sidon in Lebanon embrace many civilizations in the Mediterranean.
Historically, as Byblos was invaded and ruled by various forces, many historic sites were destroyed, but the walls built during the occupation by the Crusaders are still well preserved.
Many of the Jesus Village Church members spend more than half of their hard-earned monthly pay to save and serve their souls and deliver the love of the Lord.
It is necessary not to think about what a pastor will do for the saint, but to look at the saint as a priest and a fellow worker and bear in mind what he can do with them.
The cellular families naturally become united and the lives of the cell leaders are always full of peace.
Only a special anointing from God causes the church to grow.
Many church members leave the pastor, but they remain to the end.
There is something important for the congregation to dedicate to the cell leader.
Since the early church in the Acts of Apostles, God has dreamed that all believers will fulfill their mission as priests (1 Peter 2: 9, Revelation 1: 6) and we will all be priests of the nations.
It is because the values of the kingdom and the vision of the church have captivated them.
For us to be faithful workers of the Lord, and even laymen to serve the Lord's body church as priests, and to prove the gospel outside the church and to bring back to the Lord the great number of men running to the fire of hell.
Since five years ago, he has written a training textbook for the Sell Church's Student School, which is full of healthy identity based on the pure gospel (3:11 Classical Classics), and established healthy leaders and students.

"If nations retreat to remote islands, civilization will disappear." Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a speech on "Asia Civilization Dialogue" on 15th.
If China, the world's largest holder of US Treasuries, puts supplies at once, it will lead to decrease of US Treasury prices, higher market interest rates and the burden on the US economy.
Analysts said the remark was interpreted as a criticism of the U.S. negotiating attitude, which emphasizes its own nationalism.
While the sale of government bonds could hurt the U.S. financial market, the deepening conflict between the two countries will prompt the preference for safe assets (preferring U.S. government bonds), which reduces the effect by half.
"More active fiscal roles are required in expanding employment, strengthening employment safety nets such as the introduction of Korean-style unemployment assistance, taking measures against self-employed people, and others," President Moon said.
Cheong Wa Dae said, “We must pay special attention to the need for mid- and long-term fiscal soundness to ensure that the government's active fiscal role is maintained and that it does not place a heavy burden on future generations."
Conservative experts believe that Korea should save its financial resources as much as possible because it is suffering from a faster low birth rate, aging and slowing economic growth than other countries.
Tax revenues are expected to decrease due to worsening corporate earnings, and fiscal decentralization in the local provinces will inevitably cause the central government's Wallet to slim down.
However, controversy is likely to continue over such things as whether the government's spending is really expansionary and has enough funds.
Increasing taxes and national debt both need political determination.
It is likewise that increase in income and loan capacity happesn as an individual succeeds.
Profits should also be brought into government repository in a stable manner to ensure a balance.
Kane's jumping up and down the ground on the day he beat Ajax was able to guess that his condition had improved very much.
Kane was injured in the same area last January.
Using all three and empowering the attackers pose a high risk against Liverpool with a strong front-line pressure.
There is a debate on whether or not to choose Kane.
He said the recovery was progressing smoothly and that he would show his true worth in the final.
Kane announced on SNS that he would participate in the finals after Tottenham beat Ajax Amsterdam of the Netherlands on the 9th.
England Tottenham Hotspur Harry Kane's come back date was confirmed.
The government will develop algorithms and artificial intelligence that will permanently delete harmful expressions as soon as they are posted on the Internet, preventing even a single Internet user from watching them.
The declaration was signed by 17 countries including major EU countries, Japan, Jordan and Senegal, as well as global IT companies including Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.
A self-regulation plan that requires global IT companies to block online hate speech and harmful expressions has been devised under the leadership of France and New Zealand.
The White House on the same day launched a petition site that allows Internet users to report cases of infringement of freedom of expression on social media.
United States will preemptively respond to online terrorist content and will respect freedom of speech and freedom of expression.
The move comes after concerns that the Internet is becoming a hotbed of violent extremism, with a real-time broadcast of the killing of a person during the Christchurch attack in New Zealand.
The Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, Kim Hyun-mi and Gyeonggi Province Governor Lee Jae-myeong, appeared on the TV live screen at 4:30 pm on the 14th, when the national bus strike would start in less than 12 hours.
At the time of the live broadcast, most of the ministry's working-level officials were grasping and responding to the situation of each local government at the "Emergency Task Force for Bus Strikes", which was set up at the government's Sejong office.
In particular, Cheong Wa Dae's policy chief Kim Soo-hyun and Democratic Party of Korea floor leader Lee In-young sparked controversy over the "passing of public officials" after the recent conversation between Kim Soo-hyun and Lee In-young, who criticized the ministry's officials as "apathetic officials."
There were gossips that the situation was seen as settled by the "determination of the two politicians" even though employees of the Ministry of Strategy and Finance and the Ministry of Employment and Labor, as well as the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, stayed up all night to prevent a bus strike.
The government thinks it is fortunate to have an agreement in an urgent situation, but regrets that the minister suddenly made a live broadcast without any consultation with the staff.
During the 5.18 Gwangju Democratization Movement, plain-clothes soldiers infiltrated among citizens by disguising themselves as citizens, triggering violence and spreading false rumors.
There is a testimony that the plain-clothes soldiers also worked during the Bu-Ma Democratic Protests.
Hong Sung-taek, a former member of the Special Warfare Command who claims to have acted for a plain-clothes corps during the Buma uprising, testified in detail about his activities for the plain-clothes corps in an interview with CBS radio "Kim Hyun-jung's News Show" on the 15th.
In a radio interview with Kim Yong-jang, a former member of the U.S. Army's 501 Intelligence Unit, on the 14th, "Kim Hyun-jung's News Show" asked if there was a plain-clothes corps before the May 18 Gwangju Democratization Movement.
During his month-long stay at Kyungnam University, he approached the students and talked to them comfortably, and told the detectives who followed him to arrest them when he heard stories about the November 3rd demonstrations.
The floating interest rate on housing mortgage loan at commercial banks, which had been on the rise, shifted downward.
In addition, it has recently raised the voice of the freeze of interest in the Federal Reserve System (Fed), with the prospect that the U.S. will raise the base rate this year.
Cofix is a weighted average of interest rates on receiving products financed by 8 local banks, an indicator that is used as a base for banks.
With President Trump publicly insisting on lowering the base rate, there are strong signals that the US base rate will not see an increase this year.
Prior to this, the Korea Federation of Banks said on the 15th that the COFIX based on the new handling amount of April was 1.85%, down 0.09%p from the previous month.
Though it is not their official position, Cheong Wa Dae is clearly anxious about their Facebook attempts to improve relations with the opposition.
An official from the Cheong Wa Dae said, "There seems to be a sense of crisis in the ruling party that the board could be broken by Cho's writing in the fast track situation."
At a time when there are difficulties in real politics, Chief Cho's textbook-like writings are serving as obstacles to resolving the situation.
"There is an evaluation that Chief Cho is playing the role of the Blue House's Secretary of Public Affairs and Planning (current president of the democratic institute) played by Yang Jeong-cheol during the Roh Moo-hyun administration," a ruling party official said.
When the bill is passed, it means leaving the Blue House and going back to college.
Cheong Wa Dae also appears to be burdened by Cho's outdoor public opinion campaign.
After the four ruling and opposition parties agreed to put the law on the fast track on the 22nd, Cho wrote 19 articles until the bill was passed on the 30th.
The two sides have taken different paths, but the integration movement has recently taken place in light of the Korean people's traditional martial arts and sports.
Before K-pop including BTS, all foreigners knew about Korea was Taekwondo.
Therefore, taekwondo will be played in South Korean style in the Olympics.
In particular, Taekwondo was at the forefront of inter-Korean exchanges with the launch of the Moon Jae-in government.
During the game, South Korea's taekwondo wears protective gear on its body, head,and limbs, while North Korea only uses gloves and shoes without wearing a guard.
When looking at the world's Taekwondo circles, the North Korea-led ITF first became popular, but as time goes on, the South's WT has been becoming a trend.
The reasons Taekwondo goes on a different route are hapless.
The larger the school of Korean bitterling living together, the more pronounced this tendency was.
So far, the conventional view has been that the symbiotic relationship was formed because for clams, there are effects of spreading their larvae to gills or fins of fishes that approach the clams during the spawning season.
There were four cases in which common Korean bitterling and Acheilognathus yamatsute MORI laid eggs on the same shell.
There is a competition among species to take over more giant and wider clams, and some species have even moved their breeding season to fall not to compete with other species.
The male quickly secretes the sperm in a tube where the clam sucks water to fertilize the egg.
There are about 40 species of acheilognathinae fish in the world, but East Asia is the center of distribution with 14 species in Korea.
The locals say that this sweet melon-flavored ice cream has helped Brazilian consumers become more familiar with Korea.
Hopefully, the high-level meeting between the two countries, held for the first time in a long time, will bring good news to the business community of both Korea and Brazil.
It is also called the World's Storeroom, and the Land Gifted from God, as it is a country with the biggest production amount of soybeans, coffee, and orange, and is rich in underground and waterpower resources.
This can be a starting point for the two industries to share their concerns and overcome difficulties with partnerships to explore the possibility of cooperation.
Korean companies that have entered or plan to enter into Brazil also shake their heads, saying they have been held back by the high mandatory ratio of localization, difficult certification, and complicated customs clearance.
If the provisional plan is passed in a in a vote for and against the union on the 21st, Renault Samsung's 11 months long wage and collective agreement will be finalized.
This is because there is a high sense of crisis in that the existence of the company itself could be jeopardized if the conflict between labor and management continues to affect Renault Group's global allocation of supplies.
As labor and management succeeded in reaching a tentative agreement on wages and collective agreements for the first time in 11 months, attention is focusing on whether they will be able to solve problems such as securing follow-up export volume and sluggish sales.
The labor union's strong demand for the proposed switch-over arrangement was also compromised by introducing a process for the transfer and reflecting the wording in a single negotiation.
Securing export volume is essential to establish a stable management base since the consignment contract for Nissan Rogue for North American exports will end this year.
The latest developments in North Korea, including the launch of a projectile, and the denuclearization measures, as well as the issue of Japanese abductees, are expected to be on the table.
On the second day of his visit to Japan, President Trump will start his official state visit by playing golf with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Chiba Prefecture, Kyodo News reported on the 16th.
There are spectacular events which show the relationship of the US and Japan, such as watching golf and sumo games, visiting the Japanese emperor and boarding on a destroyer of the Maritime Self-Defense Force.
The championship trophy for the event is awarded by the Japanese prime minister, as it is called Prime Minister Championship, but this time Trump will deliver the Trump Trophy to the winner.
After Abe visited the United States in late April, President Trump visited Japan for five to six consecutive months, and the two leaders will show off their Bromance, meeting for three consecutive months.
President Trump's schedule to meet the family of the abductees will also be pushed forward.
The sumo event was reportedly proposed by the U.S. to Japan.
It was a coincidence that Paul Smith, the brand founder, entered the fashion sector.
The Japanese market is a place where Paul Smith devotes so much attention and attachment, desiging concept and sales strategy himself.
In fact, Paul Smith's outstanding business sense of anticipating fashion and popular culture trends played a significant role in the actual brand growth.
It is characterized by a unique combination of intense primary colors and calm achromatic books.
That's why Paul Smith's move is expected more.
Initially, the purpose of allowing 11-seater vans was to encourage the long-distance transportation and travel industry, but practically the vans have been used as taxis for short distance.
Tada believes that its services are legitimate and its market influence is small.
Tada is a smartphone app that calls a rental car with articles.
Even after the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport made a legal decision to Tada, the taxi industry accused Tada of violating Passenger Transport Service Act last February.
The conflict between taxi drivers and the mobility industry, which had died down for a while, is likely to flare up again.
US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency to protect US telecommunications technology and services from external threats, including Chinese telecommunications equipment company Huawei.
Huawei stated through the Chinese press, “Even if the US puts restrictions on Huawei, it doesn’t mean that US’s security is guaranteed, and it also doesn’t make the US stronger.”
Huawei warned that the US’ unfair action violates its rights and interests, and this would bring a serious legal issue.
"The executive order declares a state of emergency in response to threats from the U.S. against information and communication technologies and services, and delegates the authority to the commerce minister to ban risky transactions in the U.S. national security and other areas," he explained.
The Trump administration has argued that Huawei could be abused for spying by the Chinese government by planting back doors (a back door for steeing information) in its equipment.
U.S. officials said this measure could make it difficult or impossible for Huawei to sell some products that receive parts from U.S. companies.
The US Department of Commerce announced that shortly after President Trump signed an executive order, Huawei and its 70 affiliates would be listed on the list of restricted trading companies.
The US Department of Commerce said that there is a basis for concluding that "Huawei has been involved in activities contrary to US national security or foreign policy interests" in connection with the executive order.
Lone Star also argued that Hana Financial Group did not actively participate in delaying the government's approval in the process of acquiring KEB.
Lone Star signed a deal with Hana Financial in 2010 to hand over its 51.02% stake in KEB to KRW 4.688 trillion, but it had sold it for KRW 3.915 trillion, about KRW 700 billion lower, in 2012.
The point was that there was no "fraud" or "threat" by Hana Financial Group in the process of Lone Star selling KEB cheaply.
Lone Star claims that it was unable to sell the deal to a foreign bank that made a bigger offer such as Hong Kong-Shanghai Bank (HSBC) for six years after the sale was delayed due to approval of the acquisition and merger.
However, there is also an opinion that there is a greater chance that the government may be to blame in ISD (Investor-State Dispute) down the road since it was determined that Hana Finance is not responsible.
The lack of any responsibility of Hana Financial Group in this lawsuit has led to several interpretations on how it will affect the ISD.
Aside from the lawsuit, there is a reflection that Korea paid a lot of tuition.
There was no reason for Lone Star's error because there was no hope and compulsion.
"The fact that Hana Financial is not responsible for Lone Star's sale by cutting prices means that the Korean government is responsible," said Choi Won-mok, a law professor at Ewha Womans University, an authority on international trade.
It is said that the budget to respond ISD that Prime Minister's Office, Ministry of Strategy and Finance, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Financial Services Commission, and the National Tax Service and other government-related task force applied for reserve funds has exceeded 40 billion won by 2017 until now.
The Blue House's briefing of Moon Jae-in's government has one briefing a day with official briefing or background briefing(anonymity background explanation) from the spokesperson, so there are not many chances for reporters to meet with the officials of the Blue House.
If people post petitions directly on the bulletin board of the presidential office's homepage without any media or other channels, Cheong Wa Dae will respond if more than 200,000 other users agree.
"We are strengthening digital communication as the new media environment changes, and we believe that individual and common countermeasures to the new risks, false information, and fake news are necessary," he/she said.
Since his inauguration, President Moon Jae-in has not accepted requisitioning from the accredited reporters, but he is pointing out the reporters with the questions directly.
Although it is not impossible to contact each other individually, there is a limit to the distance between Chunchugwan, where reporters are located, and Yeominkwan, which hosts personnel above the level of secretary, and others, which are not easily contacted.
Moon Jae-in government received an application for registering new accredited reporters from September 2017, and now 30 additional new media could access.
The route through international organizations and private organizations takes longer than the direct support of the government, but it is more likely to be accepted by North Korea, and also the government's political burden due to the issue of distribution transparency is reduced.
There is a high possibility of corn as a direct aid item, and attention is being paid to whether rice will be considered.
According to the explanation of the UN WFP, it usually takes about six months or so for the beneficiaries to actually receive food after the Korean government sends funds to international organizations.
The South Korean government has been stepping up its efforts to collect opinions from civic groups and religious groups in order to promote humanitarian food aid to the North in earnest.
As reports such as the World Food Program pointed to the shortage of fertilizer as one of the reasons for the food shortage in North Korea, attention is being paid to whether fertilizer and flour, which have been provided steadily by private organizations, will be included in the aid list.
That is because there is concern that bullfighting will affect the violence of children if those under the age of 18 watch bullfighting games and attend the bullfighting school.
Matador, the main player of the game, two Banderilleros putting harpoon sticks, two Picadors riding horses and stabbing bulls with spears, plus several assistants worked together.
Cows that are stabbed in their horns and torn in the skin may be terrified, but in the stands, shouts such as Stick, Wind, and Strike.
A video of a bullfighter wiping away bull's tears before he killed it was posted on Twitter at a bullring in Spain, according to a British newspaper Daily Mail on the 13th (local time).
It is argued that a cow in its natural state is a docile animal and does not fight with another cow, and forcing it to fight is itself an abuse.
Political circles defined the fact that lawmaker Oh Shin-hwan (48) has become a new floor leader of the Bareunmirae Party on the 15th as a victory of the tactical solidarity between the faction of Yoo Seung-min and the faction of Ahn Cheol-soo, who led the creation of the party.
There were many predictions that lawmaker Kim Sung-sik, a former member of the People's Party, would win the election, but floor leader Oh, who belongs to the faction of the Bareun Party, overcame a numerical inferiority and won the election easily.
According to the party's regulation that if one candidate's votes exceed half, the opening of the votes is suspended, the total number of votes floor leader Oh won was not disclosed, but it was analyzed that Oh won in a landslide victory.
"Among the party's proportional representatives, those considering running in the Seoul metropolitan area apparently judged that it is difficult to secure competitiveness in the general elections with the colors of political parties in the Jeolla region," another lawmaker said.
The election results have been heavily affected by a great number of the lawmakers of the faction of Ahn Cheol-soo, who hold a casting vote and have turned to support floor leader Oh.
It has been also affected by the party's perception that representative Sohn is seeking to rally with the Party for Democracy and Peace along with some senior lawmakers from the Jeolla Provinces.
On the same day, all 24 members of the parliamentary election (Jung Byung-guk and Shin Yong-hyun, absentee vote) participated in the election.
Barriers between government ministries undermine the connectivity of the entire nation.
The main driver of innovation is entrepreneurship and on the basis of it is virtuous entrepreneurship.
Barriers to entry of new industries hinder industry connectivity.
Once the barriers that hinder connectivity are removed, a platform must be built to facilitate connectivity.
Safe use of data through opening is the starting point for the 4th Industrial Revolution.

It was a group who knew how one communication between the singer and one video acted as a good "attraction" for fans, and how quickly the platform spreads it.
Like teenagers, middle-aged people also flock to YouTube looking for a space of vicarious satisfaction.
Behind BTS syndrome, there were various global platforms such as SNS and YouTube, and it was unpredictable.

When an application for quarantine inspection is made, go to the site to diagnose the product status.
If labeled, all of these steps are eliminated.
Up to 600 photos were combined per letter inside the label.

In particular, as the confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties has been prolonged since the fast-track political situation, there is a growing trend of agreeing on the need to build influential centrist forces.
Many in the Liberty Korea party say that they confirmed the possibility of conservative integration based on its experience of working with Bareunmirae Party officials against the recent fast-track politics.
The party official said, "How can we judge the current government with the name of the Liberty Korea Party with which to demonstrate with those who hold the Taegeuk flag every weekend and whose leadership mentions the word Dalchang (slang to disparage the supporters of President Moon Jae-in)."
The Liberty Korea Party, as well as the Bareunmirae Party and the Party for Democracy and Peace, have been spilling out claims that "the next year's general elections should not be held this way", but respective opinions are showing considerable differences.
Yoo Seong-yop, floor leader of the Party for Democracy and Peace, made it official shortly after his election the previous day that the party will form a new party, focusing on the Bareunmirae Party, the Party for Democracy and Peace, and others, saying, "If a new party in the third district is not created, in the next general election, the Party for Democracy and Peace and the Bareunmirae Party will be annihilated."
The Liberty Korea party has set fire to the progressive camp, especially the people of Gwangju, by lightly punishing the lawmakers who denounced the May 18 movement, the controversy over recommending members of the fact-finding committee, and ignoring the May 18 insult punishment law.
Analysts say that his intention to visit Gwangju, which has strong symbolism and participate in the ceremony, is to have strong opposition from the progressive camp.
In other words, the party will have no choice but to join hands with Cheong Wa Dae and the ruling party if it faces the limits of rallying supporters or if its approval ratings decline.
He said, "The Blue House will not change its stance on the five-party consultative body, so it will be the way the president meets with the floor leaders of the three parties first and then with the floor leaders of the five parties."
Liberty Korea Party was judged as in "Unable to judge as they are too focused gathering supporters" as disparaging remarks about President Moon Jae-in and the ruling party's supporters continued.
Many analysts say that the Liberty Korea party is putting forward "difficult demands that the Democratic Party of Korea cannot accept" as a condition for normalizing the National Assembly, while it is ultimately up to the public opinion.
It seems to have the same reason as why Hwang Gyo-ahn, the Liberty Korea Party Leader, rejected the Blue House’s offer to have 'One-on-one’ meeting with President Moon after ‘One-on-five’ meeting.
Moon's proposal for dialogue seems virtually difficult due to the rejection of the Liberty Korea Party.
President Moon said at a cabinet meeting at the Blue House on the 14, "It is the people's desire to cooperate to resolve people's lives and national problems, even if politics oppose."
Yoon Tae-gon, political analysis division director of Agenda and Strategy The Moa, said, “It is a positive sign that the President emphasizes on economic vitality and bilateral cooperation. And the effect of the overall flow is that it is brought together into economy and cooperation."
North Korea's missile provocations led to a confrontation between the two Koreas, but with repeated remarks by the president, it has turned into an economic and cooperative state.
It is said that it was an opportunity to change the "political situation of missile" made by North Korea's missile launch into a state of economic and political cooperation.
President Moon Jae-in emphasizes the positive aspects of the government's economic policy day after day.
Now, it is time for policy to melt into the lives of the people and be judged that my life has begun to improve.
We hope and expect that a politics of dignity will be achieved, not a competition with harsh words, but of good politics, which is judged by policies.
Now that we have laid the foundation for the great transformation through the difficult process, we need to make real changes that the people can feel on that foundation.
We cannot expect a fair and just country without rectifying the familiarity of injustice, in which foul play, privilege, expediency and evasion have been taken for granted.
There can be no separate ruling or opposition in realizing the universal ideal of peace, the aspirations of the people, and the hopes of the people.
Let's move on to a country where peace is more firmly established, a country that has a chance to work and fulfill its dreams, a country that can achieve just results as it has tried, and a country where everyone lives well together.
We focused our policy capabilities on creating new growth engines through manufacturing innovation, fostering new industries, and regulatory innovation in the face of the challenges of weakening competitiveness of our major industries and low growth.
There is still a long way to go and a lot of work to do.
All public officials have done a good job, but the effort so far is just the start.
I hope the political community to row in one boat toward that hope.
If the National Assembly does not work, the damage will be entirely up to the people.
We do know that the people's life is tough and difficult.
Please keep in mind that the people are the president, and make new determinations to be always responsible for citizens while only serving for them.
Although it is not easy to break the order of the Cold War for 70 years, and there are still a lot of homework to solve, the new era of peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula is becoming a real challenge, not a dream.
It has been two years since the government was born as a result of the strength of the people by the candlelight revolution.
We have achieved economic development and democratization that the world admires in the past 70 years.
It doesn't look different from what it looked like before or after the candle.
In addition to efforts to strengthen the communication with the National Assembly and to support the legislative and budgetary authorities, the government should do its best to show the policy effect more promptly with more active administration.
A U.S. government official told the AP that an initial assessment of the attack by four ships, including two Saudi Arabian oil tankers, near the eastern territorial waters of the United Arab Emirates on the 12th indicated to be committed by an Iranian-backed militant group.
Bolton has been adamant about recent moves by the United States to move aircraft carrier fleets and bombers to the Middle East, saying, "It is a clear message without misunderstanding."
The U.S. is deploying the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier fleet in the Mediterranean and the B-52 strategic bomber and Patriot missiles to the Middle East.
The Trump administration has countered by blocking the export of minerals such as iron ore, steel, copper, and aluminum, which account for the largest portion of Iran's non-oil exports.
The Donald Trump U.S. administration is reportedly reviewing its military plan against Iran, which will send up to 120,000 U.S. troops to the Middle East.
However, it is not known whether President Trump has received specific details of the military plan.
Politico, a political media outlet, reported that at the Black Caucus (CBC), a group of black congressmen in the Federal Assembly, a growing number of lawmakers are supporting Biden, who is likely to prevent President Trump from re-election.
U.S. President Donald Trump makes a pick-off throw everyday to former Vice President Joe Biden, an influential Democratic presidential candidate.
Analysts say Trump is wary of Biden, who has recently emerged as a formidable rival.
Former New York Mayor Rudolf Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer, told the Guardian, "The president is hoping that Attorney General William Barr would consider investigating the Ukraine allegations."
On the same day, he expressed caution in an interview with Politico, saying "Baden's initial craze seems to see me during the 2016 presidential election."
Among the Democratic presidential candidates, concentration fire is pouring on former Vice President Biden. This is because he is emerging as a strong presidential rival to President Trump.
Biden is suspected of pressing the Ukrainian government in 2016 when he was vice president that the U.S. would not guarantee a loan unless it fired a prosecutor investigating corruption allegations at an energy company where his son belonged.
He seems to have raised issue about a fact that former Vice President Biden underestimated China on 1st by saying "China is not a rival of U.S..".
In a poll released by the local newspaper Post & Courier on the 12th, Biden won 46 percent of support in South Carolina, the largest Democratic primary race state, beating Senator Bernie Sanders by 31 percentage points.
"I think Sleepy Creepy Joe is going to beat Crazy Bernie," he tweeted on Twitter on 10th.
It is argued that if the Biden administration takes office amid a fierce U.S.-China trade dispute, the U.S. would be at a disadvantage in negotiations and would be damaged.
The prolonged US-China friction could pose greater risks than the foreign exchange crisis and the international financial crisis we have experienced in the past.
What we need now is to come up with a countermeasure from the longer-term perspective, along with efforts to pinpoint short-term impacts.
The editorial raised questions about the need for additional tariffs imposed by the two countries, the unreality of the size of US product purchases, and agreement documents that could undermine China's sovereignty and dignity.
As China strengthens its growth strategy centered on domestic consumption, it will also give us the opportunity to expand consumer goods exports.
Even if the deal is concluded, there will be damages, in which some Korean products are replaced by American ones, in the process of China’s expansion of the US imports.
Last week in Washington, the 11th US-China high-level talks were held to conclude the "monumental negotiations" of the century that President Donald Trump referred to.
If the next round of negotiations happens indefinitely, the United States imposes an additional 25% tariff on all Chinese products, and China also imposes a retaliation tariff, which is likely to lead to a full-scale tariff war.
If it turns into an all-out tariff or trade war, it is inevitable that it will directly deal a blow to our exports, which depend on nearly 40 percent of exports to the two countries.
This was not the first time violence was committed against a baby.
He was shocked enough to fracture his head and eventually died.
The baby was sometimes left immobilized for more than 15 hours a day.
The baby had several broken ribs due to the pressure of the towel that tied him.
According to the Ulsan District Prosecutors' Office on the 13th, A (29), who is living in Gyeongsangnam-do, hit his son's head and face hard when his two-month-old son cried and didn't sleep while playing games on his cell phone at 2 a.m. on January 18.
According to a prosecutor's investigation, A tied up his son's upper body and lower body with two towels to prevent his son from moving from late December to January 18 this year when he was crying.
A prosecution official said in the Joongang Ilbo that "A's wife also witnessed her husband abusing her son, but she was found to have slept on the day her son died."
Just because of one decent building it doesn't make it a cultural city.
Outside visitors are required to maintain the demand for viewing.
It refers to the phenomenon in which an urban building develops the whole area.
In advanced countries, urban regeneration has been pushed to overcome the phenomenon of urban hollowing out, which arose mainly during the process of rapid urban expansion after World War II.
In particular, there is something in common that Bilbao is a city where has already been honored by the shipbuilding and steel industries that we are struggling to hold on to currently.
Bilbao, which was not a proposed site, found out the truth and came into contact with the Guggenheim Foundation.
Spain lacks the self-righteousness to provide such assistance.
In the early 1990s, the US Guggenheim Foundation was reported to be looking for a city to attract a new Guggenheim Museum to overcome the deteriorating financial situation.
Bilbao is one of the many examples of urban renewal as it becomes a topic.
It is unknown whether they decided to support Hwang as a group, but it seemed clear that they had formed an alliance with emerging far-right politicians.
Not long ago, it was revealed that Kim Jin-sook, a leading member of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, was fighting against the disease.
The plight faced by the labor union of the Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power also derived from this trend of the times.
Ghor established the theory of how automation and information and communication technologies adopted by capitalism put the inside of the system in trouble, and why ecology emerges as an alternative.
In this debate, it was predicted that by 2025, the reduction of employees due to the decrease in the production of internal combustion locomotives would reach 2,700 people.
As the estimations were made not by the corporation but by the labor union, it suggests much.
It is an impossible demand to resume construction of a nuclear power plant that hasn't yet to be built, which is the exact opposite of the slogan of the May 1968 events in France, "Request for impossibility."
It is also necessary to examine the political ethics of the KHN labor union, but it is more important to point out critically the "difficulties" they face now.
The 20th century model of mass production, mass consumption, and mass employment with energy based on fossil fuels are becoming more and more ineffective over time.
The possibility cannot be ruled out that the North may launch a Scud-ER missile with a range of 1,000 kilometers, which is an improved version of Scud missile, in light of its continued escalation of provocations.
Coincidentally, the U.S. military's RC-135W reconnaissance aircraft moved in a similar route on the 8th, the day before North Korea fired short-range missiles believed to be Iskander-class.
Concerns are high that North Korea could make additional provocations in the near future, as it has failed to change the U.S. that maintains its denuclearization package.
Cho Han-beom, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, also said that North Korea is likely to make another provocation if there is no explicit change in the U.S. position.
According to Aircraft Spots, a personal twitter account that monitors plane's track, the U.S. Army's rivet-joint reconnaissance plane RC-135V flew above the capital area such as Seoul and Incheon on the 13th.
CEO Kim Kyu-sung reached out when the business was in a difficult situation.
Enter the type and quantity of laundry into application, and the nearby laundry staff will pick it up, wash it, and put it back in your locker.
CEO Kim said, “The business is exciting and fun as we focus on the areas that each other is good at.” “We will grow Wikibox into a global non-face-to-face business company by providing services that are implemented anywhere in the world based on the Cloud.”
On the 2nd, CEO Kim Gyu-seong and CEO Jeong Eui-sin promote friendship in front of Wikibox and Smart Mailbox at the Bucheon headquarters office.
The untact techonlogy is becoming a trend in the modern society by combining the mobile economy and the 4th industrial revolution technology.
The experience of failure and belief have become a great asset for Wikibox's growth.
President Moon has been concerned that the old ideological standards and regional sentiment "can come back at anytime" even though they have weakened since Moon Jae-in administration.
He judged that the recent incitement of the Liberty Korea Party leadership in a run-up to next year's general elections has something to do with this trend.
Key Democrats in the Democratic Party of Korea said on the 14th, "If the National Assembly is normalized through the three-party negotiations, there is no reason to not be normalized, but we cannot normalize the process by asking for another when one is accepted."
President Moon said, "So far, the focus has been on changing the big framework and introducing new policies, but it's useless if there is no result."
President Moon evaluated the opposition party by saying "nothing has changed before and after the candlelight"
There was a judgment that if they do not resolve matters that are negotiable, eventually it will be a burden on the ruling party.
During the special talks on the second anniversary of the inauguration, the government urged the implementation of the quarterly meeting of permanent political councils, which was agreed by the ruling five-party representative last November.
It means to carry out the promises agreed by the floor leader and the Blue House.
It has shifted to the perception that restoring trust within the political circle takes precedence over immediate negotiations.
President Moon Jae-in called for a strong awakening of the people in the field of politics.
It is similar to the policy stance of the 1950s, which pursued the strengthening of both defense power and economic construction, but the Kim Jong-un regime is focused on the economy.
North Korea also knows this, but it is not easy to go beyond the logic that the regime should be unshaken.
As in all countries, democratization of North Korean society is difficult to take place all at once.
North Korea's status in the international community is far more fragile than that of South Korea, where U.S. troops are stationed.
It is similar to the fact that the entire system is bound to be shaken if the content becomes poor.
The Korean War he caused is the worst event that deflected modern history on the Korean Peninsula.
Even after the 1970s, when signs of a slowdown and recession in the Soviet economy became clear, the nation's vitality was reduced and the U.S.-China diplomatic relations could not be utilized.
The tragedy of the North Korean regime is that it is not easy to reform as it has been selected based on the significant criteria of maintaining and strengthening its governance.
The North Korean regime's close attention to outside criticism and care about its economic development is reminiscent of South Korea's past military systems.
The domination theory that underpins the only governing system and the Labor Party that takes over the revolutionary party dominate.
After the war, many discourses are also led by him.
However, with the question asking if it was a violation against Sept.19 military agreement, he said "There is no certain prohibition clause clarified in the military agreement but we believe it is contrary the purpose of military agreement that Korea Peninsula needs less tension."
The broadcast cited the "Alliance 19-1" ROK-US training held in March and "Alliance 19-2" training scheduled for August as examples.
North Korea has stressed that it is "normal and self-defense military training" in response to ROK-US military training, even after the launch of the short-range projectile on the 4th.
On the 14th, the North Korea's external radio media Pyongyang Broadcast criticized South Korean military's stance that North Korea's short-range missile launch was contrary to the North-South Sept.19 military agreement.
In particular, they point out that the 9.19 military agreement, which was seen as a symbol of improvement in inter-Korean relations last year, is being interpreted differently by the two sides, overshadowing the purpose of the agreement.
In contrast to this trend, we are in a position that North Korea's series of military actions are clearly not in violation of the September 19 Military Agreement, but are contrary to the intention of the military agreement.
In order to do so, employees of the cryptocurrency ecosystem must take action.
No meaningful regulatory guidelines have been issued in the US yet.
With FinHub being mentioned and all, I know it to be a means for startups to describe their technology and the future.
How can they appeal well to regulatory officials that blockchain technology is not just a simple technology?
For now, I think it is necessary to have a more pioneering attitude.
Barclays predicted that the BOK could cut its benchmark rate in the third quarter.
Calls for a similar rate cut in both Korea and the U.S. are rising.
This is because the US-China trade war emerged as a "downside risk" before the impact of the "first-quarter degrowth shock", due to a decline in facility investment, wore off.
Inside the Monetary Policy Board of the Bank of Korea, calls for a reduction have also begun to rise.
There is even an commissioner of Monetary Policy who said, "The fact that the core inflation rate stays at 1% for a long period of time is something new in the nation's inflation trend."
According to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on the 13th, the percentage of economists who say the interest rate hike cycle of the Federal Reserve Board (Fed) is over is gradually increasing.
"If high tariffs drastically reduce consumer spending, the Fed may have to change the attitude of Patience," said Rafael Bostic, governor of the Federal Reserve.
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that "inflation is low," and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell (picture) had to say "such low figures were affected by temporary factors".
According to the committee's minutes released on July 7, "it seems difficult to assess the current level of the key interest rate as unquestionably relaxed."
Korea is burdened with financial imbalances such as largely-scaled household debt.
"The president has made it clear that U.S. does not seek war with Iran, and that the president is open to talks with the Iranian leadership." White House National Security Council's spokesman Garrett Markey said.
Professor Walter said that the final scenario is what the Trump administration can take realistically, but it is unclear whether the end will be Iran's weakening.
There are various interpretations that President Trump has unilaterally withdrawn from the United States in an international nuclear agreement with Iran last May, creating a stepping stone to increase the possibility of the Middle East war and intensifying tensions.
In the current crisis in Iran, the difference is that the Trump administration could go to war for realistic purposes.
Trump needs to show action responding to their demands for reelection while appeasing Saudi Arabia and selling weapons.
President Trump has undermined relations with European allies because of it, facing backlash in Korea while strengthening Russia and China's influence in the Middle East.
In particular, Bolton, who is passionately pursuing regime change, tries to carry through the logic of the war in Iraq, which he still advocates.
The newspaper explained that the investigators, led by former Belgian prime minister Yves Leterme, made the conclusion after meeting in Nyon, Switzerland two weeks ago.
The New York Times reported on the 13th (local time) that "European Federation of Football (UEFA) financial management committee investigators can submit proposals that include 'A Ban on at Least One Season of the Champions League' this week to Manchester City."
In November last year, Spiegel of Germany along with Football Leaks, a website specializing in soccer revelations, pointed out that Man City had been spending illegally.
Manchester City (Man City), which has won two consecutive English Premier League titles, has been reported to be deprived of their right to play in the Champions League.
Spiegel said that out of the 59,500,000 pounds caused the problem, Etihad Airways, the official sponsor of the club, contributed only 8,000,000 pounds and the rest came from ADUG finances.
The third place in the Primera Liga this season proves this.
It's time to see how much Zidane will be able to deal with the difficult task of reforming the team he's faced.
The presence of French hero manager Zidane, a legendary midfielder, has been a factor for players to hope for a transfer to Real.
Despite his strong charisma dominating the team, manager, Zinedine Zidane, who had been vulnerable to the flexible tactics of his short career, came up with the task of rebuilding the coming season.
Although the Real Madrid manger is called the "poisoned chalice," which is regarded as the grave of the tower, this season's leadership's patience was very short.
In a telephone interview with Politico, a political media outlet, he defended it by saying, "Some of the projectiles launched by the North Korea were not even missiles."
The three countries are betting that President Trump is not a good negotiator and is not ready to use military forces, the NYT said.
The New York Times reported that Trump was confident that he would tame North Korea, Iran, and Venezuela, which he called rogue states, but these countries are challenging Trump.
Some positive analysts say it seems to be using two-sided tactics of strong temperature, but others say it is a 'zigzag' move.
On the same day, the U.S. Justice Department seized the North Korean freighter 'Wise Ernest (picture),' which is suspected of violating international sanctions for being used to illegally transport North Korean coal.
Prime Minister Orban, who lost the election in 2002, started his second term in 2010, but the Barack Obama administration also boycotted him, who openly showed its ultra-rightist nationalism and anti-Western tendencies.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush flatly refused to hold the summit on the grounds that Orban defended a far-right lawmaker who said the U.S. was responsible for the September 11 attacks.
The Financial Times (FT) of the U.K. pointed out, "President Trump's hospitality with such authoritarian leaders as Prime Minister Orban would undermine the Atlantic security that has been sustained for decades."
It is the first time in 21 years that Prime Minister Orban met with a U.S. leader in the office of the White House since the talk with President Bill Clinton in 1998, his first year in office.
U.S. President Donald Trump met and talked with Hungarian Prime Minister Orban Viktor (picture), known as "Trump in Hungary", in the White House in the afternoon, on the 13th (local time).
While the apathetic attitude of public officials can hamper the country's development, the apathetic attitude of the military can ruin the country if a crisis arrives.
Negotiations with North Korea are not a sprint but a long-distance relay race, and the most important things is that a runner passes it well, so that the next runner can take over.
This is why establishing a sustainable policy toward North Korea and overcoming the conflict within South Korea are important.
It is dangerous to prevent military authorities from telling the truth.
It is because a missile couldn't be called a missile because of the rigidity of decision-making while walking on eggshells around higher-ups.
It is hard to even explore new opportunities for the remaining three years if the government tries to maintain its existing stance despite various signs of policy failure being seen.
Datazen is said to be currently seeking business tie-ups with Korea's sole comprehensive payment company and is preparing payment services using ZenPay with its business partners in the domestic and Southeast Asian markets.

Manchester City, which will have a hard time winning the championship if they lose against Brighton FC on the day, defeated their opponent 4-1 to hold the trophy for the second consecutive year.
"The only remaining chance of Liverpool, which hasn't lifted a single trophy since winning the 2011-12 League Cup (EFL), is the Champions League final against Tottenham Hotspur."
According to various sources, Liverpool became the second place team with the most points in the European top five leagues (EPL, Spanish Primera Liga, Italy Serie A, German Bundesliga, French League 1).
"For Liverpool, who has been back in the big club for the first time in two years at a major tournament, Untitled is a disgrace that they have yet to clean up."
It is Liverpool's final task to manage the condition of the players as much as the remaining half of the final, and to prepare the emblem for the decision to decide on a single game.
Liverpool competed fiercely with Manchester City (Man City) until the final round of the EPL on the 13th (Korea time), but the team ended up losing the cup by just one point.
Sadio Mane and Salah, who are both top scorer with 22 goals scored in the EPL this season, are in good shape and their defenses are centered around England's "Player of the Year," Virgil van Dijk.
Sohn Kee-chung was born in Shinuiju, Pyonganbuk-do, got a job at a company in Dandong, China at the age of 16. His commute to work was running 20 Li from Shinuiju through Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge to Dandong every day.
Moreover, the Aprok River Bridge had to adopt a suitable construction method in that it had to be firmly constructed to withstand the pressures of drift ice and flooding.
A few years ago, the National Archives unveiled a train ticket for Sohn Kee-chung, who traveled from Tokyo, Japan, to Berlin, to participate in the 1936 Berlin Olympics.
The Japanese Athletics Federation originally planned to form a team based on the Japanese, but was forced to include two Koreans.
Nam Seung-ryong, who participated in the Berlin Olympics with Sohn Kee-chung, also recalled that he ran from Hyehwa-dong to the school located behind Gyeongseong Station to save the train fare because he was short of boarding expenses when he went to Yangjeong High School.
After the reconstruction of the Anbong Railroad and the completion of the Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge in October 1911, Japan and China set up customs offices in both Sinuiju and Andong and took necessary measures.
The completion of Yalu Steel Bridge starts from the construction of a railway network that will finally be able to link Japan Railroad, Kanfu Train Ferry, Gyeongbu Railway, Gyeongui Railway, Yalu Steel Bridge, Shenyang-Dandong railway, South Manchuria Railway, Chinese Eastern Railway, and Siberian Cross Railway. It was very important in that it was.
He was married to a German woman and living in Germany after fleeing the country to escape Japanese oppression when Ahn Jung-geun shot Ito Hirobumi.
The second plan was suggested that while it was convenient to respond immediately to the need for double-track operation due to the increase in the number of trains, it was not desirable later on due to the large budget and the amount of time required.
At this time, the timber or houses are lost and floated, but the flow rate was so fast that the operation of the ship was difficult.
Currently, railways are the key issue at home and abroad, regarding such as the reconnection of inter-Korean railways, the iron Silk Road, the Eurasia Initiative, and the One-Belt-One-Road.
Here we take a brief look at the history of the Apnok River Bridge, starting with fragmentary thoughts for Sohn Kee-chung's train ticket, which was unveiled a few years ago.
The third option is not low in hypothesis cost, but it is considered that if a double track is needed later, it can be doubled by increasing the scope of delivery, and the cost is lower than the second option.
The main agent who issued the train ticket is the Japan Railroad, which is clearly marked as the second class of the Eurasian-linked ticket through Siberia and the fare of 32.87 dollars.
Before the Yalu Steel Bridge was built, logistics distribution between Korea and Manchuria was mainly accomplished by water transport between the Yalu River.
The train ticket was discovered by the Son Kee Chung Memorial Foundation while sorting out the remains of the deceased.
This is contrary to President Trump's remarks that the United States is reaping huge sums from China through mass tariffs, CNBC said.
Although the United States demanded trade agreement clarification through specific law amendments, it was reported that the trade negotiations were in a deadlock as China expressed its difficulty.
This means that the signing ceremony of the two leaders can proceed at the G20 Summit held in Osaka, Japan, June 28-29, if an agreement is reached at additional high-level trade negotiations.
In an interview with "Fox News Sunday", Director Kudlow said, "there is a good chance that President Trump and President Xi Jinping will meet at the upcoming G20 summit."
Saying "both the U.S. and China can be affected (because of the tariffs)," Kudlow said that as Chinese exporters are hit right away, it will have a significant negative impact on China's GDP."
The newspaper reported that last summer alone, high-strength bolts were delivered within three months since being ordered, but now the manufacturers answered, "It's not likely this year." when inquired.
The renovation of the Main Stadium in Kumamoto City, where the Rugby World Cup is scheduled to take place this fall, is also being delayed.
According to a survey conducted by the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism last fall, 83% of construction companies said that the construction was difficult due to lack of bolts.
Special steel timber, which is the main material of high-strength bolts, is mainly used for automobile production, and it is analyzed that the demand for special steel timber for automobiles has increased due to the increase of automobile production in Japan, making it more difficult to secure special steel timber.
This is because domestic bolt production capacity shrank due to the withdrawal and reorganization of companies during the 2008 global financial crisis.
In Japan, the construction of bridges and children's homes has been delayed, causing inconvenience to citizens.
After Ito, who had advocated the maintenance of a protective state rather than the immediate annexation of Korea, was killed, Japanese public opinion was tilted toward to force with the Korean absorption.
Baekunjang was given to Kim Ga-jin by King Gojong, who gave remains of materials and made Oh Se-chang construct a house, as Kim Ga-jin had successfully completed the reconstruction of Biwon, the back garden of Changdeokgung Palace.
He was astonished at Shimonoseki, where was nothing more than a fishing village decades ago, developed with big buildings now.
Kim Ga-jin said that Japan's development was due to the enthusiasm of the people, so the Korean people should thrive to "be a part of a perfect nation."
On May 3, 1918, Kim Ga-jin sent a letter to his son Ei-han, asking him to send a ticket that ceremonial suit had been placed in pawn shop as there appeared a person who wanted to buy royal robe during the Korean Empire.
This is because he believed that bringing together anti-Japanese intellectuals and giving them a little breathing room could prevent them from becoming radicalized or combined with righteous army struggles.
Japan hid the fact of the treaty from fear of backlash from Koreans, prompting Emperor Sunjong to issue a decree to hand over the country on Aug. 29, which we remember as the national humiliation day.
Those who felt Japan's invasiveness deeply and chose the path of riot soldiers generally lacked the awareness of civilization and the ability to push ahead with civilization, another task of the times.
A total of 76 people were titled, with 6 as marquis, including Lee Jae-Yong from an Imperial family, 3 as counts, including Lee Ji-Yong, 22 as viscounts, including Lee Wan-Yong, and 45 as the barons, including Yoon Yong-gu.
About four months after King Sunjong ascended the throne, Kim Ga-jin was appointed to the school of Gyujanggak on Nov. 30, 1907, and stepped down on Sept. 23, the following year.
It was simply "unheard strange incident" that drunk Song Byeong-jun shouted in front of King Sunjong, drew a knife and mocked a court lady.
Kim Ga-jin insisted in this article that "the power of compulsory education" is the reason why Prussia, which was almost ruined in Europe, became the No. 1 powerful country.
Kim Ga-jin's unreasonable attitude seems to be because he knows Japan better than anyone else and tries to prevent Gojong's abdication by reading Japan's hard-line policy beforehand.
Song Byeong-jun was pushed out of his place because of the persistent demands of the members of the Korean Association, led by Kim Ga-jin, and public sentiment.
At that time, the Japanese Military Police released a confidential report saying, “The Korean people are very pleased because the Korean Association often hold conference recently and attacks the Cabinet."
Although mutual partnership efforts seemed to be going smoothly, such as holding a joint speech session between the Korea Association and Iljinhoi, the situation changed dramatically due to an unexpected incident.
It is unfortunate that such an organization failed to take active action to stop the annexation even seeing the patriotic soldiers as mob.
It was all too sad if merely keeping silent and not being used for Ogaki's maneuvering was the maximum action that agitators, including Kim Ga-jin, could do on the eve of country's demise.
8 people including, Daewongun son-in-law Cho Jeong-gu and Cho Gyeong-ho, Japan-Korea Treaty member Han Gyu-seol, leader of Gabo Reform of 1894 Yoo Gil-jun, and Min Yeong-dal, Yoon Young-gu, Hong Sun-hyeong returned their title 2 years later.
Kim Ga-jin and the Korean Association concentrated on the case of Song Byeong-jun, center of Iljinhoi who was drunk on the train in January 1909 when King Sunjong was touring Pyeongan Island.
For this reason, Kim Ga-jin established the Giho school (integrate with Younghee school, founded by Yoo Gil-jun, and leads to Chungang High School today), and made efforts to found nation with education by going to the Giho school every day even in rain or wind.
Kim Ga-jin became sick with anxiety and grievances when the country failed and the Giho society was dissolved before the effort paid off.
This view, shared by many leaders during the Enlightenment Movement, including Kim Ga-jin, was so naive.
As this rumor spread, the whole nation was gripped by anxiety.
Japan was greatly embarrassed when it became clear when emissary party appeared on the international scene and claimed that the Eulsa Treaty, the agreement between Korea and Japan, was due to Japanese coercion.
Kim Ga-jin argued, "If all of our 20 million compatriots die, who would our emperor rule the country with?" and added, "It makes sense for us to pray with all our heart," when the Japanese foreign minister comes to Seoul.
Compared to Singapore or Hong Kong, it is a tough struggle to survive as it is being pushed out of the global company attraction and growth is lagging behind.
Such places are more than one or two even in Seoul.
The decision is based on the judgment that Japan has no choice but to live.
It would be frustrating for us where metropolitan regulations are enforced.
It is often sad that the reality of our country's provinces is like this.
In that respect, governments and private companies have many points to reflect upon.
In that regard, it is necessary to prepare a way for large companies to participate in such a way like Japan.
In other words, regional development projects should be followed by a careful and meticulous strategy.
If Korea is to be competitive in the city, such drastic deregulation is urgently needed.
We know that if we let the private sector make money, it would be a big deal.
Among them, the Marunouchi area of Tokyo Station is a representative development project.
Although there is consensus, the government has no countermeasures if public opinion rises.
Most important companies have left behind, so there was no way to hold on.
It is a warning that educated young people in rural areas are flocking to big cities for opportunities and that the resulting brain drain is stifling growth in underdeveloped areas, accelerating the exodus of local talents.
I was thrilled that Pete Bertigig and John Delaney, who are candidates for the Democratic Party's presidential candidacy, actively support it.
Here is one question we should focus on.
National service does not solve all of the problems that the United States has.
Because everything is related to the digital revolution and globalization.
This has become the question of our time.
As the controversy spread, floor leader Na immediately apologized, saying, "I used the word without knowing the exact meaning of the expression and its specific origin."
In particular, concerns are high over a series of tough remarks by party officials in the Seoul metropolitan area, which is classified as a "rough region" unlike the traditional stronghold of Yeongnam.
Although the remarks are interpreted as a strong statement intended to rally supporters, critics point out that excessive "want for support" politics could eventually hamper the expansion of external relations.
A lawmaker in the Seoul metropolitan area said, "No matter how hard you put your efforts into the public sentiment of your local constituency in normal times, if bad news such as denigrating remarks on the May 18 Gwangju Democratic Movement happen, you will be helpless."
Following lawmaker Kim Moo-sung's statement on "bombing the blue house", floor leader Na Kyung-won also used the online slang "Dalchang" which disparages President Moon Jae-in's supporters at the rally, which aroused a controversy.
It was not perfect suit for Hwang Hui-chan, nicknamed "the bull", as he has good movement from the side to the center combined with a reckless breakthrough.
Considering his position as a side striker, it is regrettable.
Hamburg had the possession of the ball and knocked on the goal.
Hamburger kept the conversation going about signing Hwang Hee-chan permanently to the team, but was passive concerning the financial burden of EUR 5 million (approximately KRW 6.4 billion), the transfer fee proposed by Salzburg.
The prevailing view is that Hamburg's passive negotiation attitude has upset the deal.
Having been promoted to League Division 1, if Hamburger operates games mainly with counterattacks since the offense and defense position are switched from now, it is expected that Hwang Hee-chan will be in a condition that he can make use of his advantages and style more.
The Bundesliga 2 has the top-two teams going straight to the first division league and the third-place team going into the promotion/relegation playoff, but Hamburg's current position is fourth.
As Manager Becker said, Salzburg gave one-sided notice.
There are forces trying to destroy our country by digging into the shortages of our society.
Everyone who I meet these days are worried that it won't be easy for the Democratic Party of Korea to win the next general election.
It's sick psychology that justifies the past of the media that suppressed democratization forces in addition to vested interests, and at the same time, the apologies for those who did the democratization movement.
When the congreeman Lee In-young defeated Kim Tae-yeon and was elected to the National Assembly, some media also interpreted the Democrats as if they had rebelled against the president Moon Jae-in.
The so-called conservatives have giggled at fake news while spreading them.
Only after Chief Secretary Lim Jong-suk retired, such fake news disappeared.
Representative Hwang Kyo-ahn will meet with floor leader Lee In-young in an official meeting soon.
I hope you'll take a good look at who's making this criticism.
Rumor has it that the chief of staff, Im Jong-seok, is controlling all appointments.
Anyway, I guess I wasn't the only one to think that Hwang Kyo-ahn's remarks targeting at former Chief of Staff Im Jong-seok were seriously wrong.
When the Liberty Korea Party goes to the extreme right, we will quickly take control of the midfield and win the general election.
In May, the queen of seasons, wedding invitations are delivered from all over the place.
Since the 2010s when smartphones have become available for almost everyone, it has become common to exchange invitations for mobile devices.
Last year, about 78% of the 120,000 customers who ordered paper wedding invitations through the company also made mobile wedding invitations.
As the number of empty requests has increased, the government has banned the sending of invitations at all the
They could have chosen one of the phrases offered by the wedding invitation maker, but the Kim couple didn't want to.
Looking at the contents and forms of wedding invitations in chronological order, we can see at a glance how the marriage culture of Korea has changed.
In some European countries, such as Germany, where many choose to live together instead of getting married, it is hard to accept wedding invitations.
Unlike in the past, which tried to show off the family's reputation with the number of wedding guests, a growing number of people are seeking small weddings.
When a customer orders a paper wedding invitation from the company's homepage, they are said to choose a few items and then a mobile wedding invitation will be made as well.
It was important in the past who the officiant was, although there are many WEDDINGS WITHOUT OFFICIANTS these days where the bride and groom read the covenant and their parents read letters their children.
It is written in the voice of a third party, “I'd like to light candles at a wedding of the above two people, so please come and bless them”, while the names of the six family members are also listed side by side as invitees.
As with the writing, it is the photographs that the couple put so much work into.
According to the Nikkei Asia Review and Bloomberg News on the 10th (local time), Vice Premier Liu said to the Chinese media after the trade talks.
For the Chinese, Americans, and the rest of the world, we're going to deal with this reasonably, he said. "We're not afraid of China and not also afraid of Chinese."
The New York Times and Bloomberg Communications reported that China refused to make legislation.
But, "It's not that the trade talks are over," the deputy Prime Minister Ryu said. "It's natural to face problems during the negotiations and it's inevitable."
Liu, the vice prime minister, did not elaborate on the Principled Issue, but he apparently expressed antipathy to Washington's demand for legislation on key issues, including how to reform subsidies.
The letter said members of the Economic Security Council who signed the statement said they would repay their loans within two years, but it seems unlikely.
It is not known how Syngman Rhee used the KRW 10 million that was donated.
This is why the contents of political funds were so noticeable in Syngman Rhee's letter.
Preston Goodfellow shuttled between the US military government and Syngman Rhee, helping Rhee to fulfill fundraising missions.
According to a study closely tracking the process of 10 million won received by Lee Seung-man, they were all members of the Korea Economic Security Council and most were wealthy.
At a time when Economic Security Council was founded and fund was raised, Representative Democratic Council of South Korea (Democratic Council), the representative organization of the right wing, was established by Goodfellow's coordination and maneuvering, and Rhee Syngman became chairman, Kim Gu and Kim Gyu-sik became vice chairmen.
At that time, it was obviously preferential treatment and illegal that the financial institution lended a huge amount of $20 million.
Nothing illustrates the realistic goals it aims at, the trick of power, and the desire of the people involved, like political funds does.
It was the most significant part of the US military government's propaganda, and the most important media to promote its policies to farmers.
The purpose of their initiative was to promote rice collection, but it was simply ostensible and the main focus was to raise political funds to support the activities of the right wing.
To understand complexity, and relations back and forth quite a long explanation is needed.
Rhee sent a letter to Millard Goodfello, who returned to the U.S. on August 5, 1946 after serving as a political adviser to Lt. Gen. John Haji, commander of the U.S. military government.
Being highly well-made does not necessarily mean to be well-known.
It is an answer quoting "It's 2015" which was an answer given by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau when he was asked about the background of the formation of a gender-equivalent Cabinet.
He was once scolded when he gave a long answer to the case that was pending in court, so he gave a simple answer, which caused a big misunderstanding.
It is an era when the media environment changes rapidly and there are no absolute methods.
A corporate public relations manager once said, "We can't imagine not putting a picture of the chairman's face in the middle, and it is impressive to see Blue House placing the president at sides."
In the process of promoting two-wing communications together, which is indirect communication through the media and direct online communication, I came here.
We hope that our contents will be shared by the people and become viral.
In the new environment, of course, what you have to do is direct communication.
The content that are made by fans and distributed through social media is added.
The concert is priced at $ 199 and includes a fan signing and a photo event with the singer.
K-pop is also formidable in scale from an industrial perspective.
The event that involves taking pictures or shaking hands with the singer is called "Meet & Greet", and it costs minimum 200.000 won to participate.
Meeting a star in itself becomes an expensive commodity.
This musical characteristic is also a factor in popularity, but one of the biggest backgrounds of K-pop's popularity today is the digitization of the way popular music is distributed and consumed.
MXM is not yet a hugely popular idol in Korea.
In addition to the fan meeting, the 10 people who bought the most cosmetics were given an opportunity to visit a preliminary press conference and take pictures with Lisa.
While K-pop is gaining popularity, there are voices of concern on the other hand.
This year, a youth novel based on K-pop was published in Spain.
This is because it's easier to introduce themselves in the country.
BoA ranked 127th on the Billboard 200 chart in 2009, and 2NE1 reached No. 61 on the same table in 2014.
Girls' Generation, Kara, Rain, Wonder Girls, Boa, and 2NE1, which were the most popular in Korea at the time, entered the market but all failed to advance to the top of the billboard charts.
In the case of the Korean Wave in music, it seemed that the song "Choryeon" by the dance duo Clon released in 2000 gaining huge popularity in Taiwan was a starting point.
It is generally believed that the Hallyu became a cultural phenomenon attracting attention both at Korea and abroad after the success of the drama <What's Love>, which ran on CCTV, Chinese national broadcast, in 1997.
Since then, Psy's "Gangnam Style" has gained huge popularity in 2012 recording the top 2 on the U.S. Billboard singles chart, which has served as an opportunity to expand K-pop to the whole world.
This is because now the relationship between South and North Korea is good, so there are more customers than before, but I don't think it will continue to be like this forever.
In front of a restaurant for Pyongyang-style cold noodles in Jung-gu, Seoul on the 7th, there is a line of office workers visited the area at lunchtime, cars and parking attendants pouring into there.
Pyongyang's cold noodles became popular among young people after the summit meeting between President Moon Jae-in and North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un held this time last year.
Pyeongyang cold noodles, which has a plain but deep-flavored broth, and Hamheung cold noodles, which is a tough but spicy and savory dish, are representative dishes of our cold noodles.
It is that after class, the senior Lee "regularized" it to go to a Pyeongyang cold noodles restaurant near Sinchon, which made him know the taste of Pyeongyang cold noodles.
The Cheonggyecheon area, including Jongno and Euljiro, used to be a place where displaced people were providing services to make a living, and naturally there were many Pyeongyang naengmyeon restaurants.
There were not many restaurants specializing in Pyeongyang cold noodles, as it was difficult to make broth, which takes a long time, and learn the know-how to produce noodles.
This is because Pyongyang cold noodle enthusiasts are spreading across generations and classes.
K (49), who has been a salary man for more than 20 years, is excited about lunch break when she meets with four of her college classmates once a month.
The scene in which our art company, including the girl group Red Velvet, who had a performance in Pyongyang a month earlier, ate Pyongyang cold noodles at Okryugwan in Pyongyang, also aroused curiosity among young people.
That is now becoming the opposite.
The taste of Pyongyang naengmyeon, which I ate at a Pyongyang naengmyeon restaurant with my father when I was a high school student, was so bad that I said to myself, "It tastes so terrible."
The Korea Communications Standards Commission has issued a "Recommendation" to MBC Sports Plus, which commercialized foreign female cheerleaders and evaluated their looks during the commentary on the pro-baseball game.
The Korea Communications Standards Commission said on the 2nd that it has issued an administrative guidance recommendation to MBC Sports Plus for the broadcast of the "2019 Shinhan Bank MYCAR KBO League-Hanwha Eagles vs. NC Dinos" game, which was broadcasted from March 29th and 30th.
Several cheerleaders have complained of similar damages since late last year when Samsung Lions' cheerleader Hwang Da-gun (19) complained of sexual harassment.
Committee, Park Sang-soo said, "There is a problem with the expression of commercializing women while continuously showing images of certain cheerleaders on the broadcasting."
"Han, Myung - Jae Castor and Yang Jun - hyuk, commentators on March 29 broadcasted a conversation about Doris Roland, cheerleader of Hanwha Eagles."
Attention is being paid to whether the U.S. and China will be able to reach a dramatic settlement in the frontal conflict.
At the same time, he said it is "possible" to reach an agreement, saying that the most respected deputy prime minister (Ryu hui) among senior Chinese officials is coming.
The move is interpreted as an attempt to buy time for negotiations by delaying the imposition of tariffs until after the Chinese cargo leaving after the time of the tariff increase arrives in the U.S.
China's delegation, led by Deputy Prime Minister Liu He, US Trade Representative (USTR), and US Delegation, led by Treasury Secretary Stephen Mannusin, resumed negotiations at the USTR office in Washington, DC on the 9th.
The New York Times (NYT) also said that the two sides have earned additional time, saying, "If the agreement is reached, President Trump may retroactively withdraw the increased tariffs."
However, it is widely expected that additional negotiations could take place even if the tariff increase is made on July 10, as there is still room for actual application.
As the US tariff hikes and China fight back with retaliation, the expansion and prolongation of the US-China trade war is expected to have a major impact on the global financial market.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that US-China negotiations would begin at 5 pm local time in Washington, D.C. (6 a.m. Korean time).
This means that the U.S.-China trade war will be decided at the talks, which took place about seven hours before the scheduled tariff increase on Chinese products (at 0:01 a.m. on the 10th).
President Trump also introduced President Xi as saying in his personal letter, "Let's work together, let's see what we can do."
The US Air Force deployed the latest stealth fighter F-35, which was on the US mainland last month, to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Aldapra Air Force Base in the middle of last month.
The US Air Force has unveiled a photo of the B-52 Stratofortress bomber arriving at Qatar Al Udeid Air Base on the 9th (local time).
James Mulloy, commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet, said during the interview with Reuters, "If the carrier had to be sent into the strait, it would do so," and emphasized, "It would not be restricted or challenged by the operation of the fleet anywhere in the Middle East."
The U.S. Navy also issued a statement that an aircraft carrier fleet led by the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, Abraham Lincoln, passed through the Suez Canal and entered the Red Sea.
The Strait of Hormuz is an sea region that divide the Arabian Sea from the Persian Gulf, used as a route where crude oil produced by Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar are exported.
It has been a year since the U.S. unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the agreement.
He said that it fits well with the atmosphere and culture that Korean Air pursues.
"In fact, I wasn't sure that I was nominated because there were a lot of tall players," Bjena said, but confessed, "So I wanted to show my skills with high jumps and strong spikes during training."
He was even 4 centimeters shorter than coach Park, who picked Villena.
However, there were no signs of surprise.
When asked if she could do well in speed volleyball, Bjena replied casually, "I like fast volleyball, but I don't have a problem with high volleyball."
Regarding the U.S. analysis that the North Korean missile is a ballistic missile, the National Intelligence Service reportedly reported that "It is not the official position of the U.S".
As to why the presumed location of the launch was changed from Sinori to Guseong in North Korea, the Defense Ministry reportedly admitted to being wrong.
The report was attended by Lee Hye-hoon, a member of the National Assembly, Bareunmirae Party, Kim Min-gi, a member of the Intelligence Committee, and Lee Eun-jae, a member of the Liberty Korean Party.
The National Intelligence Service said there is high possibility that the short-range missile that was launched by North Korea on 9th was likely to be a new weapon system.
NIS reported in a non-disclosure report on the National Assembly Intelligence Committee on 10th that "The reason for the delayed analysis of missiles by North Korea is that it may be a new weapon system."
There are many instances where weapons become more and more similar in appearance as technology advances.
"Unlike the East-European Bloc's multiple rocket launcher, which used to suppress large-scale massed troops with loud noise," the 300mm multiple rocket launchers fired y the North on the 4th hit the target point accurately."
Military threats against us are steadily increasing in various forms.
Gyeryongdae can be hit as well as the U.S. military's Pyeongtaek Humphreys Base and Osan Air Base.
As the military is developing new tactical ballistic missiles, such as the Hyunmoo-2D, there is possibilities that competition for developing short-range missiles between the two Koreas will emerge.
It is therefore important for the manager and the club to see and verify directly on site.
Michael Sanchez, who played for Korean Air in the past, said, “I know a tight training schedule because I have experience in Korea.” raising his experience.
There was a keen sense of real league play in the tryout.
Although not as much as in the past when criticism was made of "All at once volleyball," the weight of foreign players in running the team is still not small.
The athletes who came a long way from different continents and cities flew toward the volleyballer as if they had forgotten their nostalgia.
This is because the likelihood of getting nominations is high even if the ranking is low in the pre-preference survey based on submitted profiles such as career or physical condition.
Nineteen players pour their all-out effort on the court to be nominated, while the club and the coach continue to think for a long time outside the court to distinguish between good and bad.
Korea Volleyball Federation (KOVO) analyzes the data of the volunteers collected and looks for various matches through the YouTube and other interested players.
The U.S. Department of Defense refrained from using the term "missile" for the projectiles fired by North Korea on the 4th, making no official comment on the type and specifications of the missiles.
"I would like to warn North Korea that if these North's actions are repeated, it could make current dialogue and negotiation phase difficult," President Moon said.
This is in line with the fact that the US and the United Nations have focused on the medium- and long-range missiles in the midst of North Korean ballistic missile provocations and have not responded directly to the short-range ones.
This is a frontal violation of the UN Security Council resolution and is expected to wave in the future.
In a photo released by the Central News Agency, Kim is observing the drill.
Interestingly, ROK JCS or Korean Ministry of National Defense used the ambiguous expression, expected to be a Short-distance Projectile, while the U.S. Department of Defense settled down as a Ballistic Missile.
It was also said that as public consensus is needed, if the president, the ruling, and opposition parties hold consultations together, they can also expect the effect of resolving the stalled domestic political situation.
It was made clear that the government has no choice but to implement welfare policies through jobs at a time when the social safety net for the elderly is absolutely lacking.
President Moon said he decided to discuss pending issues through a "Permanent Ruling-Opposition-Administration Consultative Body on state affairs" agreed upon by the ruling and opposition parties, adding that he expects sincere cooperation from the opposition side.
It was repeatedly emphasized that the investigation into and empathy for the liquidation of anti-constitutional acts, such as state and judicial manipulation could advance cooperation.
President Moon judged the second summit between the U.S. and North Korea in Hanoi failing to reach an agreement as "a kind of protestant nature" against the U.S. or South Korea.
"We caution against North Korea's resolutions on ballistic missiles and violations of the inter-Korean military coalition, and warn that North Korea's actions can make negotiations and dialogue difficult."
Although there was an amplitude, but the job situation showed a positive indicator.
Liverpool beat Barcelona at a time when the Premier League's leading scorer Mohamed Sala (22 goals) and Roberto Firmino (12 goals) were missing from the three-man "Manura" line.
"In the final, it is expected that the main players who failed to play in the second round of the semi-final will return and recover their condition."
This year, the "Big Ear (Champions League Trophy)" will be taken by a team from Tottenham Hotspur or Liverpool, who has become the main characters of the great reversal.
"In the history of the Champions League, including the European Cup, which began in the 1955-1956 season, this is the second time since Manchester United (hereinafter Man U) and Chelsea played the final match in the 2007-2008 season."
In the case of Tottenham, Harry Kane, who has also scored 17 goals in the Premier League this season, has been absent for a long time due to an ankle injury.
I've seen you visit a lot of companies these days.
Only 9% of humanity around the world enjoys freedom of speech, while South Korea is Asia's top free press country, which ranks within 9% according to the Reporters Without Borders.
It is a problem that criticism toward the collocutor is flowing into personal attacks.
The question contains the person's view of society.
The interviewer continues with the inquiry, saying, "There might be a view of the reason why North Korea made an additional provocative act is that we did not have a firm definition to these kinds(North Korea) of provocations."
"The amount of rice that our government has in stock far exceeds domestic demand, costing about 600 billion won each year in storage costs," President Moon said.
As a food aid method, direct government support was mentioned.
A diplomatic source said, "We wanted to use the food aid as a yardstick for the resumption of inter-Korean and North Korea-U.S. dialogue, but the North's firing of weapons following the 4th has deepened our agony."
The food aid issue will be discussed at a meeting of the South Korea and the U.S. working group, which will involve Lee Do-hoon, the foreign ministry's special representative for Korean Peninsula peace and security affairs, and Stephen Biegun, the U.S. State Department's special representative for North Korea policy.
There is a voice saying that if the projectile launched that day by North Korea was not a medium-to-long-range missile or a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) that the U.S. is sensitive to, the situation should be watched a little more in the future.
The cold reality is that the revised constitution proposed by the president is rejected by the National Assembly due to the boycott of votes, and that the Liberty Korea Party is all-out against the government-proposed bill to revise the local autonomy law.
With the help of several strategists of the ruling party, the variables of the remaining three years of the Moon Jae-in government have been summarized.
This means that there are more voters who want to maintain the regime, rather than change the regime.
A good performance in the election does not mean that the legislative coalition for reform, the designation of a fast track for reform bills, and the passage of the bill's plenary session will take place on its own.
Given the presidential election schedule, power within the ruling camp will begin to shift to the next presidential candidates around this time.
The presidential system is mismanaged in a way that he takes unlimited responsibility.
Externally, the president represents the nation, but internally, he is only the chief of the administration.
That is why the Democratic Party of Korea, along with President Moon Jae-in, is struggling for the election of members of the National Assembly next year.
If the basic framework is maintained, it would be possible to increase the number of lawmakers.
Many are calling on President Moon Jae-in to increase talks with the opposition party.
During his term, President Moon Jae-in has the 21st election of members for the National Assembly on April 15th, 2020, and the 20th presidential election on March 9th, 2022.
The denuclearization negotiations between North Korea and the US have stalled due to the breakdown of the North-US summit in Hanoi in February, but this is not a disappointing step.
You need to get away from the rush and get access with long breaths.
While maintaining the direction of easing economic inequality and strengthening economic democratization, specific policies need to be tailored based on pragmatism.
Concerns of war have heightened on the Korean Peninsula due to the North's nuclear and missile provocations, but the South Korean government actively engaged in three inter-Korean summits and opened the door for two rounds of summit talks between North Korea and the U.S.
Considering that the two Koreas, North Korea and the U.S. have long built a wall of distrust, it is abnormal to expect that resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and establishing a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula will be possible in a short period of time.
The South Korea's economy is finding little breakthrough, although major economic indicators such as growth, exports, investment and employment are worsening.
It is to strengthen the communication with the opposition parties and create the conditions for cooperation.
An official of the Korea Communications Standards Commission said, “The commission does not independently decide through monitoring, but takes adequate measures when there is a request for review from an agency.”
According to the reporter's personal visit, four places, including "Beijing and Simyang in China", "Pyongyang in North Korea", and "Vladivostok in Russia", were possible locations as departure and destination.
After completing a relatively simple procedure, a reservation number will be provided.
National designation is also noticeable that it is different from ours.
Some sites were classified as acts that endanger security and were blocked from access.
They have been confirmed to be able to access only to government-controlled intranets.
In the case of violating the National Security Law, the investigative agency such as the National Police Agency or the National Intelligence Service decides the legitimacy of the content and requests Korea Communications Standards Commission to review the corrective action.
The spokesman's remarks suggest that for the time being North Korea will refrain from military demonstrations that could be considered provocative by the international community, beyond the level of the launch.
North Korea made an official stance on the launch of a missile controversy on the 4th that "it was not aimed at anyone but a normal military training for self-defense."
North Korea's Chosun Central News Agency reported this in a form of question and answer by a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry on the 8th, four days after firefighting drills led by chairman Kim Jeong-eun.
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry also mentioned recent developments in US-ROK joint training, including "Alliance 19-1" training and aerial training, suggesting that the launch was a response.
In a statement by a Foreign Ministry spokesman, expressions such as 'defense forces', 'normal' and 'self-defending' were used repeatedly, and the words missiles and rockets were not mentioned at all.
Google will also allow users to automatically delete location, search and app activity information within 3 to 18 months.
Google announced that its new neural network technology, RNN, has reduced the need for 100GB for speech recognition to less than 0.5GB.
Google announced it will introduce an "incognito mode" that will prevent it from tracking Google app usage history at the annual developer conference "Google I / O" held in Mountain View, California.
The strongest point is that you can experience Pixel 3’s camera, which is known for its outstanding resolution, at a cheap price.
Because usage records are not sent to servers, Google and other providers do not know what users did.
Besides the advantages of faster speed, it is also advantageous in terms of personal information protection as user data is not allowed to go outside and is only left inside a Smartphone.
As Dr. Cho Chun-Ho requested, it would be better if there was be a place to discuss what political action is necessary for science to be connect with the earth.
"Science Day" can also be used as a day to let people know what science is telling them about the world and the earth.
When discussing what, how, and why should we research, sometimes scientists or public officials of the science department find it hard to show one's opinion.
What is particularly noticeable in his book, which has a lot of friendly explanations and heavy suggestions about climate change, is that he wrote when he left the National Institute of Meteorological Sciences, so he left the "civil servant in science area".
As a civil servant, especially as a "Scientific Official", it would have been prudent to mention "Political action", but now as a "Scientist", his warning of climate and the future of mankind, and calling for action have extraordinary weight.
Dr. Jo Cheon-ho concerns about how to connect science with government, politics, and the world as he has said carefully but clearly laying aside ”the sense of public officials.”
This is not to say that the boundary between science and politics is meaningless or that science is all political so we should not care what a scientist says.
In this context, more weight has been added to the observation that President Trump would have addressed the issue of South Korea's defense contribution separately from Saudi Arabia.
It seems that the entire allied countries, including the members of the NATO, that President Trump demanded an increase in the division of defense expenditures were targeted, rather than specifying a particular country like South Korea or the Saudi.
Some say that even if President Trump's country that can't reveal its name refers to South Korea, it doesn't have to be significant.
In his speech at Green Bay, Wisconsin, on the 27th, President Trump also mentioned that he is losing "USD 4.5 billion" in defending the country, citing "a country that cannot reveal its name."

According to the International Financial Center, overseas organizations interpret North Korea 's provocations as a way to secure leverage in future negotiations with the United States.
It is that Councilor Kim said, "It is better to increase the construction deadline than to hurry it off," but some suffering from international sanctions on North Korea was behind his remarks.
In particular, North Korea's trade with China last year saw a sharp drop in imports of several goods, including trucks and electrical equipment used in the construction industry.
In the end, it was a launch that included calls for sanctions relief, which is also proof that the North Korean economy is in a more difficult situation than is known.
Many observers say North Korea's launch of a new tactical guided weapon on the 4th is a provocation by Secretary of State Kim Jong-un against US adherence to sanctions on North Korea.
38 North interpreted that Councilor Kim's order for safety may be due to the collapse of a new apartment in Pyongyang in 2014, but actually it was due to blocked import routes for construction materials and other materials.
"China has retreated from its previous commitments," said Representative Lighthize on the 6th, adding, "If there is no change in attitude, we will increase tariffs on imported Chinese products starting at 0:01 on the 10th."
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, following U.S. President Donald Trump, said that he would increase tariffs on Chinese imports starting on the 10th (local time), claiming China broke its promise.
In particular, President Trump has pushed China with confidence based on the highest support rate (46%) since his inauguration and the highest economic boom in history, drawing keen attention to the Washington negotiations from the 9th to the 10th.
When Chinese negotiators came up with a deal that included additional concessions to the U.S., President Xi said, "I will be responsible for all the consequences."
Indeed, the Chinese negotiators told the US negotiators that they would not agree to change Chinese law, Bloomberg reported.
(After the trade agreement), major issues including whether to maintain tariffs on China are still unresolved, he said, reaffirming that tariffs will be imposed on the 10th at the moment.

"Goldman Sachs said that if China sent its delegation to the United States as planned, it would be because they believe the discussions on settlements is still possible."

The briefing participants did not mention on what part they retreated their position and representative Lighthizer simply said that he is worried that the agreement style and the rewriting of the documents surrounding this can make them retreat in a serious settlement.
The trade representatives of the United States and China have announced that "there was a productive conversation," after last week's negotiation in Beijing so a final settlement had been expected in this week's negotiation in Washington.

If you use these two devices to convert lighter and heavier states to faster and repetitively, as if you are breathing in and out, the plane moves forward.
Professor Rae says, "During the half of Phoenix's flight time, it is heavier than the air, and during the other half, it is lighter than that."
Compressed air is released toward the tail, additionally pushing the aircraft forward.
To speed up the air, a powerful engine is essential.
The research team explained that the advantages are that production costs are inexpensive as this plane does not require a complex engine design, and that it requires much less energy and is capable of self-supporting.
The thrust generated by an aircraft powered by variable-buoyancy propulsion is not comparable to an engine plane.
To do this, the plane body must be much larger.
Against the backdrop of a huge population, the production and sales of cars increased by 1 million units every year, ranking second in the world, surpassing Japan in 2006 and ranking the first, surpassing even the U.S. in 2009.
The method is that while foreign companies produce and sell cars in China under their own brand, Chinese companies acquire advanced technologies.
Following the 1984 Beijing Automobile Works’ collaboration with AMC of the United States, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation initiated the production of cars in collaboration with Volkswagen of Germany in 1985.
However, due to the temporary accumulation of funds, the electric vehicle market also faced a bubble.
The Chinese auto market has been hit by two unfavorable factors, government regulations and the slowing economy.
With the possibility of independent production, this time, the limitation was the growth of the automotive industry.
Even if you have money, you cannot buy license plates.
In particular, the pure electric vehicle sector is drawing great attention from the Chinese government because there is no international leader in this sector yet.
China, which has been able to avoid being a developing country in the internal combustion engine car market, is accelerating in its electric vehicle to "rise in the car sector."
The slogan "Just Electric" was hung at the Volkswagen booth at the 2019 Shanghai Motor Show in Shanghai, China, last April.
This is why China has started to secure its own brand.
This market structure was formed because the state-owned companies that were established while developing the automobile industry in 1960s was placed to various regions.
Chinese Government's budget for fostering electric vehicles is astronomical.
It was a stage where new energy cars such as electric cars were introduced in earnest as new engines amid saturation of the automobile market due to the global economic slowdown.

The domestic situation in the U.S. becomes very urgent these days.

For individuals, bringing and using cash, several credit cards, and various reward cards is very inconvenient.
It becomes the main channel for users' money to move.
In "Card Power" South Korea, people are interested in how mobile payment will destroy the stronghold of credit cards, which account for 90 percent of payments.
With a large user base, industry officials say various businesses are possible, including financial services, advertising, and brokerage.
Although speed varies from country to country, the growth of mobile payment is clear.
All of the world's leading IT companies have jumped into the competition for mobile payment.
In the United States, a suzerain of simple payment, Pay has gradually replaced personal checks (checks) and cards from technological development areas such as San Francisco, and in Japan, where people love cash, the Pay offensive has begun.
Customers of this store have been using Tencent's mobile pay service "WeChat Pay" (Chinese name Weissinjpu) more than Alipay.
According to big data companies' transfer statistics, Alipay held the lead of the Chinese Easy Payment Service market with a market share of 53.78% in the 4th quarter of 2018.
Alipay is serviced by Ant Financial, a subsidiary of Alibaba Group which is the China's largest e-commerce company.
If you want to make mobile payments in China, you need to have a balance in your account.
"Credit cards are for the rich, and mobile payments are for the poor." This is what Chairman of Alibaba Ma Yun said at the Davos Forum in Switzerland on January 24, 2019.
While Naver tries to keep its focus online and expand offline, KakaoPay is expanding online based on KakaoTalk, which has a strong mobile presence.
Even with skyscrapers, people could easily find office workers who often walk to work in the morning near the ”Convention & Exhibition Center” station on Shenzhen Subway Line No. 1.
The analysis that mobile payments have been activated because telecommunications and credit card infrastructure is not well established in China or to prevent counterfeit money transactions is fragmentary.
WeChat Pay also has a strategic partnership with Naver and is preparing a plan where users of WeChat Pay, Naver Pay, and Line Pay use Pay service in different areas.
Today, more and more companies are using platform-based business models.
Information based on this technology cannot be changed arbitrarily, which makes the transaction more reliable and easier to track.
There are a number of risks in every investment, just as every investment has two sides, opportunity and risk.
Blockchain technology has emerged as a solution to these concerns.
"According to a report on the blockchain ripple effect published by the World Economic Forum (Davos Forum), about USD 8 trillion, 10% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2027, will be stored by blockchain technology."
Or they will move to Asia, where it is less burdensome than Europe.
Although Ronaldo (21 goals), who has won numerous golden boot between England and Spain last minute rage serve as a variable, the race for the golden boot is progressing smoothly for Quagliarella.
Roberto Mancini highly appreciated the seasonality of qualiarella.
Quagliarella's heyday began this season 10 years later.
You can assume that Quagliarella's self-management is thorough.
For Italy, who suffered a humiliating setback when existing one-top strikers such as Lorenzo Insigne and Ciro Immobile failed to win the finals of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, the existence of the Quagliarella is equal to that of Heaven.

On the surface, it is a SRPG (Strategy·Simulation Role-Playing Game) format, but act of buying and taming women is the key on the inside.

"In the case of the actual clinical case, the catheter is controlled by a surgical staff seated 2 to 3 meters away from the procedure table."
If a surgical operation tool goes just two millimeters away from the normal path, nerves or blood vessels may be wrongly touched, resulting in a major medical accident.
In March last year, news that heralded the big bang of new technologies was heard from medical device industries.
Not only in Korea, but also in developed countries such as the United States, local small and medium-sized hospitals do not have enough surgical robots and if it has price competitiveness, it will have a chance to export them overseas, according to the development team.
KIST development team explained that the guide arm can also be localized by applying its indigenous module robot arm called "Mode Man", which was introduced through the first episode of "Robot Goes" in March.
Japanese media predict that the Japanese government's countermeasure will take place at a time when the actual shares have been sold and even cashed in.
Japanese Foreign Minister Kono Taro announced that he would take action quickly if a Japanese company actually suffered a loss in connection with compensation for forced labor." according to NHK broadcast.
Foreign Minister Kono also criticized Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa, who said the compensation process is under the jurisdiction of the judiciary and that the administration should not intervene.
It takes about 3 months for the stock to be sold and cashed in.
This request is a request to sell a Japanese securities that have already been seized and then change to cash in order to collect the loss compensation amount, which was recognized by the Supreme Court.
Although the US is already actively involved in the Korean Peninsula, the US-ROK alliance and USFK cannot see the same role of the US and other neighboring countries as the parties to the Korean peninsula.
Russia held a summit meeting between North Korea and Russia on April 25, and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he was willing to meet Kim Jong-un Without Conditions.
The past six-party talks were negotiations that were created in the context of rejecting the bilateral talks with North Korea on the grounds that Bush administration can give legitimacy to the North Korean regime as "axis of evil" and it is difficult to regulate North Korea's behavior.
However, with the surrounding countries expressing interest in the issue of the Korean Peninsula, efforts should be strengthened to allow them to play a constructive role in the peace process.
This can provide a motivation for the North to speed up denuclearization by enhancing the benefits and security of the regime.
Called a Tactical Guided Weapon, not a ballistic missile prohibited by the UN resolution, it implied that provocations could be made in the future while avoiding catastrophic situations.
Contrary to that, the US is likely to increase its voice calling for easing sanctions on North Korea, which is negative for the resumption of the six-party talks.
The six-party talks produced the "September 19 Joint Declaration" in 2005, but ended up showing limits in resolving distrust between North Korea and the U.S. and have been suspended since 2008.
Although the North and the U.S. have not closed the door for dialogue since the Hanoi meeting, they are focusing on strengthening their position rather than resuming dialogue.
There is no more chance for Japan to deviate from the intentions of the U. S..
In other words, the internationalization of the Korean Peninsula issue is underway in earnest.
This trend was driven by the expectation that the collaboration with Binance chain would increase the likelihood of Binance being listed.
If, as the company wishes, Binance DEX has as much volume as the existing Binance Exchange, the existing public blockchain platforms cannot afford the huge volume.
At the time of the launch of the Binance Chain test net, 8 dAPP projects announced plans to move the platform from Ethereum to the Binance chain.
As there is a network that Binance has built with the exchange business, there are also dAPP (Decentralized application) projects that choose the Binance chain.
Binance said, "Binance DEX went through a 2-month test net period, with 8.5 million transactions being made during that time," emphasizing that DEX had already accumulated significant transaction data.
It is because when US senator George Mitchell investigated pro baseball players' use of banned drugs, he was found to use growth hormones.
If you think about it reversely, you need to use growth hormones as much as developing side effects to improve your performance.
Dan Duchaine, a physical beauty athlete called the “steroid guru”, actively encouraged his disciples by experiencing himself the effects of direct growth hormone.
The decision of Barcelona, which seemed reckless at the time, was a great success, as the history of the future proves.
Kim Young-hee's body overflows with growth hormone was due to the tumor of the pituitary gland.
Since it was a big problem for him not to grow tall no matter how good he was, Messi began to inject a needle of a syringe containing growth hormones into his legs every night.
It is the evidence of the lack of protective measures for damaged children.
75% of the abusers were the parents including stepparents, and the overlapping abuse, which commits several abuses simultaneously, such as emotional abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse accounted for the most.
The 12-year-old girl, who was found dead in a reservoir in Gwangju, was killed by her stepfather, mother and biological father after being subjected to physical abuse and sexual abuse.
This means that the current punishment does not provide sufficient alarm.
The level of punishment should be raised so that the actual preventive effect is achieved.

In particular, food service sales in March increased 89.8% to KRW 68.81 billion, almost twice that of the previous year.
Among commodity groups, home appliances, electronics and telecommunication devices, which have seen a sharp increase in demand, such as dryers and air purifiers due to fine dust, increased 40.1 percent, and cosmetics that have increased orders from China also increased 22.6 percent.
The Statistics Korea recently concluded that the competitive discount competition of food ordering and delivery platforms had an influence.
According to the "March Online Shopping Trend" released by Statistics Korea on the 3rd, the total amount of online shopping transactions in March rose 18.6 % to KRW 11.195 trillion compared to the same month last year.
Online shopping for food service items has nearly doubled due to discount competition in food ordering and delivery platforms, including Yogiyo and Baemin.
Doosan Bears' Kim Jae-hwan (31), who won homerun king with 44 home runs, was in total a total of nine home runs, including two in March, six in April, and one up to May 3rd.
Following Choi Jung and Hanwha Eagles Lee Sung-yeol (35), Samsung Lions Lee Won-seok (33), Lotte Giants Jeon Jun-woo (33), LG Twins Yoo Kang-nam (27), KT Wiz Park Kyung-soo (35) and Hwang Jae-kyun (32), and NC Park Seok-min (34) flew six each.
KT Wizzelrohas Jr. (29), who was second in the group, had nine home runs, including three in March and six in April.
Whether there is an impact on the ball will require precise analysis at the end of the season, but it can be felt that the overall home run has decreased.
The same teams as Kim Jae-hwan, José Miguel Fernández (31), Park Byung-ho and NC Dinos Yang Eui-ji (32) have seven home runs to form a joint leading group.
They were also strong candidates for Ballon d'Or, the highest-profile award given to active players, as they represent the two leagues.

"Former Arsenal manager Ars?ne Wenger, who has been a guest commentator in Britain's 'Non-Sports' after the game, pointed out Bandaiq's mistake."

In addition to complaints about limited coverage, such as inside the building, criticism that it is difficult to find differentiated service with only differentiated service for 5G.
If mass-production of Nokia's base stations, which have been stumbled in mass-production, starts and 5G repeaters and femtocells or small, low power cellular base stations are established by the end of this year, it is expected that much of this will help resolve the controversy over coverage.
Mobile carriers and the government have no doubt that the core task of spreading 5G services is to secure customer trust by stabilizing networks and services.
With the telecommunications company deploying about 100,000 base station equipment in one month, the quality complaints showed a significant decrease.
Its task in B2C area is to find innovative contents that can fully experience performance of 5G's ultra-fast and ultra-low latency beyond VR and AR that are upgraded from LTE.
To relieve the pressure that Luis Suárez and Messi had on the front.
In Liverpool's Sri Top, the share of Firmino is very large.
Former director Jujae Mourinho played a similar role for defender Pepe during his time in Spain's Real Madrid squad was done to Pabinue.
This is to prevent Alba from advancing high in the attacking situation and making use of the open side space to connect with the Messi.
The ball possession takes place in a forward space to target a comeback goal, pulling up the line of pressure, resulting in a relatively loosen backroom.
Barcelona's attack flow will vary depending on how effectively Melo is able to decompress against Liverpool midfielders who are trying to pressure strong in the front.
Pique's experienced skill in reading the forward movement of Wijnaldum stood out.
However, except for the return of Firmino and Trent Alexander-Arnold, who were excluded from the first leg, there would be no big difference in the tactics.
Manager Valverde provided the basis for Messi's play with the anomalous numbers of Vidal's advances and Roberto's use in midfield.
Intense pressure from Wijnaldum to Keita, James Milner, and Fabinho, the team tried to prevent the ball from reaching him as much as possible.
His recent share in Barcelona has been so strong that some local media have identified Melo as the key player of the match.
To keep Vidal in check and secure Liverpool's option for a forward pass, Wijnaldum had to come down a little lower, but he couldn't.
It will be a little longer to see if Messi keeps his promises to his fans, but it is clear that Barcelona's momentum is fiercer than ever.
Barcelona's weakness was found from the side, apparently referring to the first leg of the quarterfinals that Manchester United had earlier.
Barcelona turns into an anomalous 4-4-2 form, with Ivan Rakitic on the right and Philippe Coutinho coming to the left to defend, but the cover is not fast.
It was partly due to Keita's injury that he had to modify his tactics, but it was clear that head coach Klopp had failed to respond to head coach Valverde's strategy.
"When the first game was played, the overall flow on the pitch was that Liverpool played well despite Wijnaldum's slump."
We wonder what kind of game changers manager Klopp will bring in in the second game.
Liverpool, which had a lot of activity, was lulled in the second half, and the movement was noticeably slowed in connectivity process.
Liverpool will certainly take the risk of the backspace and play an aggressive attack move in the second leg, which will be played in Anfield home on the 8th.
The reality is that the majority of pastors in Korean churches are paid as little as the minimum living expenses.
You shouldn't generalize in front of believers just that you like golf.
If your circumstances allow you to play golf, there is no reason to refuse to play golf as a pastor.
"Sometimes the scene of playing golf with the pastors, and sharing their news of the church and their denominations, and cheerfulness of their pastor's past and present were seen."
"In 2017, the number of domestic golfers has surpassed 36 million, and golf is no longer criticized for being a major culprit of luxury."
Given the cost and time, it is too much to call it popular and not a social atmosphere just for playing golf.
Golf may cause a bone between the pastors and the believers.
There are only a few pastors who play golf and other people involved.
People who play golf know how difficult it is to group reservations.
The habit of being treated in the church seemed to be exposed to the body.
In other words, the system is not keeping up with the pace of industrial development.
It is also expected to contain the results of the probabilistic item research conducted by the Game Water Management Committee.
There is a lot of amount of money to be screened for game classifications, but most of the game developers who make flash games are young students, so they cannot afford to pay.

Back then, it wasn't that difficult to make a new relationship and become a "Twitter Friend" by exchanging mentions with strangers.
It is natural that the short or long writing that one posts reflects the nature and character he has had over the decades.
It may be a cliche, but it reminds me of the old saying, "Out of sight, out of mind."
There are people who declare, people who express, and people who promote.

The "operator" sorts these photos into reference points, called "cloud points," makes modeling, and then "clean-up" managers go through "retopology" to tailor the initial complex 3D modeling for use in real games.
The visual center to which 3D scan studio belongs, the sound studio which plays various sound, and the AI (artificial intelligence) center are the representative reinvestment targets of future technology.

Seanet said that Samsung Electronics was slow to respond to the battery explosion immediately after the initial report was released at the time, fueling anxiety and discontent among consumers.
CNET says a device that bends a screen flexibly is a revolution of the smartphone, but consumers are still in doubt about its durability.
In particular, the market itself could die out if the image of "defects" is overwritten because the mobile phone market in the form of folders has not been formed.
Some of them mentioned cases of the display screen damage of Galaxy Fold on their SNS, etc., and the defect was known.
It is estimated that it will cost up to KRW 2 trillion.
The Ministry of Science and Technology, ICT announced on March 19 that it operates the "5G service inspection public and private task force (TF)" together with mobile communication company and mobile device manufacturer to stabilize 5G and improve quality.
The International Organization to enact Wireless Network Standards, 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) has named the commercial name of 4G as LTE (Long Term Evolution) and 5G as NR (New Radio).
According to the current status of the three mobile carriers submitted by Rep. Byun Jae-il of the Democratic Party of Korea from the Ministry of Science, ICT, and Information and Communication, the number of 5G base stations was tallied at 85,261 in the country on the 3rd, the day of commercialization.
Global market research company TrendForce predicted in its latest report that 5G penetration rate will be only 0.4% as it has not secured enough base before 2022 when this line will be settled.
The number of 5G base stations is less than a tenth of the total station number of 4G LTE, which was commercialized in 2011, of domestic mobile telecommunication companies (832,380).
The development of contents that will give users the right not just to increase the number of base stations is also an important factor for the success or failure of 5G.
Korean mobile telecommunication companies started the commercialization of 5G with the goal of "world first" but did not have enough bases to operate the line normally.
Experts advise that improving the quality of circuits requires government policies and the operational capabilities of companies along with increasing the number of base stations.
After switching to 5G phone, there are many times the connection is lost, and "LTE phone speed has slowed since 5G was launched." said a posting on SNS on the 21st, three weeks before 5G commercialization.
The problem lies in the fact that ordinary wireless network users who use only smartphones or tablet PC-level mobile devices have no reason to consume content beyond web surfing, games, and watching movies.
The three Korean telecommunication companies opened 5G line at 11 p.m. on the 3rd (Korean Standard Time) and started the process of linking mobile devices.
For sports fans in Korea who have experienced professional baseball operating at 10 ballparks, the sport with only one stadium will inevitably be suspected of "Normal Operation."
They then claimed that they removed the protective film from the Galaxy Fold they received to confirm the criticism that the problem occurred after removing the liquid crystal protection film, and experienced the same problem.
The video starts with the filming of flowers using the Galaxy fold, and the images of citizens exclaiming at the functions of the Galaxy fold.
Gizmodo, a U.S. IT magazine, reported that "the launch event for the $2,000 Galaxy Fold, which was scheduled to take place in Hong Kong and Shanghai, was postponed," quoting Richard Lai, the Chinese editor of Engadget.
A journalist in the U.S. refused to review it, saying, "We are not a prototype beta tester," and mocked it by comparing it to a half-folded sausage bread.
"We postponed a product briefing event for the Galaxy fold reviewer, which was scheduled to take place in China. It is difficult to confirm whether the release date is postponed or not," Samsung Electronics also said.
The transfer of the big club from Ajax to Europe seems likely.
Dutch national team manager Ronald Koeman recently interviewed a media source and predicted his move, saying, "De Ligt will definitely head to a higher league level."
"The value of their team, which was valued at 100 million euros (about 128 billion won) in 2014, has jumped to 450.1 million euros (about 580 billion won), more than 4.5 times."
The Netherlands AFC Ajax Amsterdam was put in the midday crisis.
Coincidentally, Cristian Ericsen, Jan Berthan, Tobi Alder Balealt, and Darvinson Sanchez are also active in the semi-final opponent Tottenham's Ajax Youth Academy.
Ajax players also contributed to the Netherlands' outstanding performance in the European Nations League after failing to advance to the 2018 World Cup finals.
There was an atmosphere to acknowledge the coming of the game and try to actively reflect the opinions of the fans for the development of the league.
However, there are still tasks that need to be solved next season to take a leap further in the face of the depressed popularity of basketball.
However, as the number of foreign players' quotas decreases, domestic players are expected to increase their weight.
Seoul SK's Kim Sun-hyung scored 49 points in the KT match in January, becoming the third-highest scorer in a single match in Korean history.
It seems that more thought and discussion is needed on whether to cut the flow of the game too much and whether to conduct video readings on scenes where the game can be changed from where the game is to where it will be played.
In fact, the gap between second place Liverpool and third place Tottenham Hotspur (67 points) is wide with 18 points.
You can flip your ranking just by having a draw once.
In fact, every game is no different from the final.
Except for last season, when Manchester City won the title with 100 points, it is the score to be on top of the table in the history of the Premier League for 26 years.
It is unknown which team will take the Premier League Champion Trophy.
It can be inferred that the competition between the two was very fierce at the time, given that all the Premier League winners had only 70 points in the 1996-1999 and these three years.
The Goyang International Flower Fair will be held at Ilsan Lake Park from April 26 to May 12, with 350 organizations and groups from 30 countries participating.
I am thankful to the point of tears for spring flowers that grew while carefully picking out sunlight from amid the air full of fine dust, and I welcome the blue sky like a dear guest after being attacked by fine dust.
The ruins of Jeongok-ri in Yeoncheon are a global historical site where hand axes from 300,000 years ago were found, evidence that "very smart Paleolithic people lived there."
The festival features flower garden experiences including planting succulents, making frame pots, and experiencing a beetle set as well as a flower bike experience on the water.
Byeokchoji Culture Arboretum features a pond lined with vines and weeping willows, a cool and spacious lawn plaza surrounded by trees, a Queen's garden boasting colorful flowers from spring to autumn, and a European-style sculpture park.
Goryeosan Mountain, located in Hajeom-myeon, Ganghwa-gun, is covered in beds of azaleas, and visitors can enjoy the full bloom of azaleas through five hiking trail courses.
At the entrance to the festival site in Jeongok-ri, Yeoncheon, there is a flower grass garden where visitors can enjoy spring, offering a variety of spring flowers including azaleas.
The Spring Flower Tulip Festival will be held at the Byokchoji Arboretum, located in Gwangtan-myeon, Paju-si, to mark the spring.
Scientists found that the fish was similar to a fish that was extinct 66 million year ago, which was only found as a fossil 400 million years ago.
Living in a deep-sea cave with few competitors, it was able to maintain its past form, but it was not fixed in an ancient primitive fish state.
Instead, a large notochord sits below the spine and back skull.
Coelacanths breed in an ovoviviparous manner, in which eggs hatch in the stomach and it gives birth to babies.
This was the result of the brain's very slow growth compared to the rate at which the skull grew.
He pointed out that "The air-conditioning and heating system of the elementary, middle, and high classroom ignores airflow and humidity. It is a uniformed structure that air is easily polluted in a short period of time," he said. "The market response in the field of air conditioning, heating, and cooperation system has improved, but there is a long way to get rid of fine dust, "he said.
Utilizing the appropriate Molycacillus as a vaporized humidifying filter medium, the patented device has recently been rapidly increasing in value due to extremely low quality of life due to fine dust.
The characteristic of a "Humidity and Ventilation Air Circulation System" that Ryu succeeded in developing after overcoming hundreds of failures is that it effectively manages indoor air quality at low cost.
This device, which does not require regular filter replacement, also has the advantage of being easy to repair at low cost in case of failure.
Multi-use facilities such as schools and hospitals, where indoor spaces are sealed, will slowly reduce oxygen and increase carbon dioxide levels if not ventilated frequently.
Even if they went just before commercialization, the disadvantage of having to replace expensive part every six months at the longest was an obstacle for them.
The fact that Molecualr Sieve, which can be dried within three minutes when heated and spit out 100% of the water again, has already proven stability and effectiveness in Germany for nearly 20 years, has attracted Ryu.
He also volunteered to repair the refrigeration plant in a distant place where others were reluctant.
The "Molecular Sieve," which has a very good humidification function, which releases 100 percent water again when heated after absorbing water, has come as an oasis to Liu, who was wandering in the middle of the desert.
Only God will exactly know why.
Ryu had subsisted then decided that he needed a breakthrough to build a business foundation.
Developed through industry-academic cooperation with Chonnam National University, the product did not shine through as much as expected due to the relatively low social awareness of the harmful effects and seriousness of fine dust and yellow dust at that time.
This is because not only did the establishment of shopping malls and securing products require expenses that are difficult for individuals to pay, but the market was limited.
Makeshop, operated by the Korea Center, is committed to supporting the operation and management of shopping malls to generate continuous sales.
Characteristic is the emphasis on convenience and expandability of operation of shopping malls.
If this trend continues, it is expected to exceed 130 trillion won this year and once again set another record.
In other words, a start-up market with no age limit has been opened from teenagers to older people.
Many countries concentrate on the North Pole for research on global warming, but they have another reason of huge underground and fishery resources in the ocean 30 times the size of the Mediterranean Sea.
Yun explained, “It's hotter because glaciers have recently melted due to global warming, which has opened the ocean path connecting the Pacific and the Atlantic.”
In the inauguration speech, Yoon announced that the Polar Research Institute would open its doors, as progression would be limited with internal manpower alone.
As a result of this, it is sometimes loose, like Conton Call, toward the Korean Peninsula and toward the northeastern United States, bringing about cold weather and heavy snowfall.
"It's an environment where you can see the lowest bottom of the mankind, and it's a time when a man becomes the most humble in front of nature," says President Yoon Ho-il, who has devoted himself to the polar research for more than 30 years at the Korea Polar Research Institute and has been to Antarctic bases so many times.
If competition is inadequate, it is common practice to build an industrial structure policy that promotes the entry of new cheap phones by using the network through directly setting up the network or adjusting the network cost as needed.
It is hard to say that a proper demand will be formed.
5G subscribers, estimated at around 3% for the first year, are expected to be the type of buyers who buy once new products are released.
This is because it is difficult to deal with because of the detailed history and the accounts of it, and it has already become the matter of an organization.
It will take time and money to expand the nationwide network, which is why the rate at which customer bases move to 5G will have to be adjusted.
As Samsung Electronics "Galaxy Fold" was disgraced due to controversy over its poor performance just two days after its release, attention is also being paid to other foldable Smartphones competitors such as Huawei and Xiaomi.
Unlike the 4 companies focusing on plastic as finishing material for the screen, Apple focusing on the glass as finishing material is paid attention.
The reason why Chinese competitors cannot laugh on the fault of Galaxy Fold is because foldable phones of three companies such as Huawei also use plastic film substrates instead of tempered glass.
Plastic substrates are easy to bend but not as durable as glass.
Any similar problems with Galaxy Fold can occur.
Folding and unfolding a few times can scratch or wrinkle.
It was a protest that the mancity fighters were handball foul.
It was so difficult to make accurate judgments that the referee replayed the video several times.
The referee looked back at the situation with the VAR and decided it was intentional.
The ball touched the left arm of the rose rushing for a tackle.
"After completing the match, Manchester United coach Pep Guardiola admitted the offside, saying, "Probably VAR would be correct" for the final Stirling score, but he shook his head at Llorente's goal."
In particular, the effect was different depending on which gene you have.
Research has shown that lutein and zeaxanthin, which is good for eye health, can also help prevent colon cancer.
As a result, the incidence of colorectal cancer was about 75% lower in the highest group (intake of 4.35 mg per day) than in the lowest group (intake of less than 1.95 mg per day) when divided into quartiles based on the intake of lutein respectively.
Research team at the National Cancer Center's International Cancer Research Center, Prof. Kim Jung-sun and Ph.D. graduate student Kim Ji-mi (Ph.D.), analyzed the interaction of Lutein and Gia xanthine intake with colorectal cancer through food and "DICER1" genes, (Scientific Reports) in March on 18th.
Under the consent of the subjects, DNA samples and information on usual lifestyles and dietary intake were provided to analyze the association between lutein and zeaxanthin intake and colorectal cancer.
2019 LoL Challenges Korea Summer Preliminary Competition will be available for participation through the official website of LoL Challenges Korea by the afternoon of 30th.

The New York Times (NYT) reported on the 16th (local time) that groundless conspiracy theories over the cause of the fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France are all over the Internet.
YouTube explained that there was an error in the algorithm.
In fact, the Paris prosecution, which is investigating the cause of the fire, said it has found no circumstantial evidence to be considered arson and that it is highly likely to be fire caused by mistake.
"InfoWars," known as the far-right U.S. conspiracy site, defined the fire as a deliberate attack on Christians without foundation.
A YouTube channel created to deal with fake news also found traces of weaving the story of the Notre Dame fire and the September 11 attacks.
After CNN protested, Twitter removed the account.
Tiktok's parent company ByteDance raised objections, saying this decision could threaten freedom of expression, but India's Supreme Court rejected it.
Reuters reported that Google removed TikTok from its Indian Play Store on the 17th.
TikTok has already been cited as a window for sharing obscene materials and has been banned from use in Bangladesh.

Samsung SDS said on the17th that it is strengthening its competitiveness in the logistics business with differentiated services through new technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain.
Samsung SDS applied its AI analysis platform Brightics AI to its logistics platform "Cello," which can analyze the demand for products distributed and predict sales.
Samsung SDS has commercialized the country's first "logistics blockchain distribution history management service," which provides the entire aquaculture-shipping and distribution of fishery products transparently, for ASK Export Councils and consumers made up of local fisheries processing companies by utilizing Nexledger.
Samsung SDS used Deliver to successfully verify that it recorded container information from Busan to the Netherlands on the Hyperledger Fabric in March and then sent it to Etherium, an open blockchain.
Deliver is a platform specialized for international trade that supports connections between different blockchain networks, as well as data connections between blockchain networks and existing systems.
Brightics AI is an AI-based analysis platform developed by Samsung SDS so that it can quickly process a large amount of data and easily use AI such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning and other functions that are needed for analysis.
As a result of introducing the Brightics AI, it is confirmed that the accuracy of predicting AI demands is 28% higher than that of manual tasks.
"In the five production lines of the B district, where the production process can be examined, the P20, which was launched last year and the P30, the flagship phone of this year, are being made."
Most of the steps such as barcode scanning, quality check, and packaging were done without a single touch of a human hand along the 120m long product line.
One side of the wall of the factory was filled with job descriptions and the photos of employees who presented and were selected the ideas of improving the smartphone automation process.
"People could see that verification was done between each process such as attaching or assembling parts, etc."
It takes 28.5 seconds to make one smartphone, but it focuses on quality verification, including 12 hours and 30 minutes for aging test of the product (checking smartphone life).
Most of the players who played against Manchester United, including Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets, Gerrard Pique, Arthur Melo and Clement Lenglet, didn't play the game.
"If we look at the Primera Liga match against SD Uesca on the 13th, which was 0-0 draw, we can see Valverde's determination to focus all his energy on the Champions League."
In the round of 16 against Lyon, France, they played to a 0-0 draw after empty space in the first leg, but returned to Nukamp and poured in five goals.
As it was then, the victory of Barcelona will end.
That's why manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said, "This season, we won the away game against a good team." looking at the situation positively.
All over the gigabit-class wired Internet is available through optical-LANs, and buildings built before 2010 do not have such LANs.
Wi-Fi applied to public places such as subways has no connection with the Internet.
LG Uplus, the first service provider of LTE-based Wi-Fi in the subway, has not yet started commercializing 10Gb Internet and Wi-Fi 6.
This new security standard must be applied to newly developed wireless devices to receive Wi-Fi 6 certification from Wi-Fi Alliance.
Initial beamforming was applied to only one user (SU-MIMO), but as the AP and terminal antennas increased, it was available to multiple users simultaneously.
One device can be assigned to each RU, through this up to 74 devices can be connected to a single AP.
Gardasil also has a 9-valent vaccine (6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 types), which shows a 30% increase in prevention compared to the original 4-dose vaccine.
Vaccination is needed not only for daycare centers or kindergarten children, but also for teenagers living in groups in schools and dormitories, and for adults traveling to prevalent areas such as the Middle East.
It is analyzed that the vaccination rate of middle school and high school students is relatively low compared to the elementary school students and younger ages.
Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, "Now, it is actually more effective to follow the hygiene rules, such as hand washing and cough etiquette, rather than vaccination, given that it takes two to four weeks for antibodies to be formed."
In the case of Japanese encephalitis, which was considered one of the essential vaccinations for infants, the age group has expanded since the introduction of Imojev by Sanofi Pasteur, the first vaccine to be licensed not only for infants but also for adults, in 2015.
In hospitals and clinics, infants can be immunized twice a year, with two doses in 12 to 24 months, and adults only once in a single dose, making the lifelong immunization possible.
The development of a "Mixed Vaccine" that broadly protects against multiple types of diseases with a single vaccine, and the tendency to "Age Expansion" that can be inoculated at a wider age are becoming apparent.
Spraying type injected at a speed of 200m per second instead of a metal needle was recently developed in the United States and approved by the FDA.
As the number of inoculations decreases, the timely inoculation rate of infants and toddlers with a high risk of infection and complications can be improved, increasing the total inoculation rate and having prevention effects accordingly.
Patch type delivers injection drugs into a human body when a patch with micro needles, which are too tiny to watch, attached tightly is applied to the skin surface .
In particular, since measles has broken out sporadically in some parts of the country since late last year, health authorities inevitably remain vigilant.
According to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the 15th, 32.2 outpatients per 1,000 outpatients were diagnosed with influenza in the 14th week (March 31 ~ April 6), five times more than the epidemic standard (6.3) in 2018-2019.
Unlike the National Immunization Program (NIP), where the trivalent vaccine is free, the quadrivalent vaccine must be paid at their own expense.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is considering including the NIP of the flu vaccine in the future.
He quickly defended so that the space behind them would not remain vacant when the offensive rights were transferred to Chelsea.
César Aspilicueta took a role to mark Manet and block him.
Navi Keita of England professional football team, Liverpool led the team to victory.
In particular, Mane with his excellent sense of goal was intensively weighed.
Thanks to Keita, who played the role of softener in the process of fast-changing offense and defense, Liverpool was able to pull off a 2-0 victory.
As for whether players on the 40-man Major League Baseball roster will participate, he said, "We expect the Major League Secretariat to take other measures as tickets to the Olympic finals are at stake. We will come up with a conclusion after consulting with the secretariat."
South Korea will face Australia on November 6th, followed by Canada (7th) and Cuba (8th) in preliminary matches at the Gocheok Sky Dome in Guro-gu, Seoul.
Premier 12, where a ticket for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics is at stake, will give the ticket to Tokyo to the highest-ranking among Asia and Oceania countries except for the Olympic host Japan.
WBSC President, Ricardo Prakari, said, "The Premier 12 will play a big role in baseball which needs to be secured and globalized by young fans."
"Objectively, Korea's record is said to be dominant, but I'm worried as a coach," said Kim Kyung-moon, the coach of the Korean national baseball team, and pledged, "We will do our best to impress the people."
"It is explained as coach Sarri's plan as there are the pressure on Liverpool's home game, which had been no losses in 37 matches, and his shift to defensive position in a situation where he was tired from physical strength three days before the match."
In other words, the ball was not properly put into the center.
Emerson Palmieri, David Luis, Antonio Rudiger and Cesar Azpilicueta were all four back, while Kepa Arrizabalaga wore goalkeeper gloves.
When they meet strong teams that focus on deploying the ball to the center, you can imagine manager Sari's choice as practical management.
"Two minutes later, Mohammed Sala defeated Palmieri in a one-on-one match, then scored a wedge with a left-footed middle range shot."
Unusually, there were a lot of straight, long pass-oriented attacks.
In the face-off between the aces, Azar was defeated by Salah.
Callum Hudson Odoi, Eden Hazard, and Willian composed three top, while Ruben Loftus Cheek, Jorginho, and N'Golo Kante backed up.
Chelsea's two center backs have given up short pass-oriented build-ups, many of which were direct long passes to Hazard on the front.
In the first half, the team might have focused on a quick attack-defense switch with Hazrd at the front, but tried to play the game with a substitution card after the middle of the second half.
"It is expected to be followed by a series of next-generation line-ups following NaThaParkLee (Na Seung-bum, Eric Thames, Park Suk-min and Lee Ho-joon), which had 115 home runs in 2016 and terrorized the opponent."
If middle batters such as Na Sung-bum (0.394, two homeruns), Yang Eui-ji (0.386, five homeruns), and Park Seok-min (0.293, five homeruns) are getting power, while Park Min-woo and Christian Betancourt, who have returned from injuries, are gradually boosting their batting sense.
If Bae Jae-hwan and Kang Yoon-gu of the bullpen, who have combined for 10 holds, and finisher Won Jong-hyun, who is ranked first with eight saves, overcome their physical problems, the pitchers will be even more complete.
"Mo Chang min, who has been playing with a batting average of 0.404 in 15 games and if recovering from a hamstring injury murder's row that nobody can go against will be completed."
Observers say that if players who had been slowed by injuries and sluggishness in the beginning of the season join the team or recover, they will show a more frightening momentum than they are now.
It is hard to explain without Yang Eui-ji that young guns such as Park Jin-Woo (2 wins and 1 hold average ERA 1.83) and Kim Young-Kyu (3 wins average ERA 2.86) are doing their best with clearing the injuries of the starters.
Since it is still in the early stages of 5G service, the relay broadcasting was delayed for 10 seconds than the actual scene because of less technical settings.
An eye-catching event took place on the afternoon of the 13th, when the information and communications technology (ICT) industry had been worrying about the lack of contents to impress 5G mobile communication service (5G) customers.
Goldman Sachs predicted that the global e-sports industry will grow sharply from about 1 trillion won last year to about 3.3 trillion won in 2022.
The number of real-time users who want to watch the broadcast is also in the thousands, so the expansion of the popularity of the broadcast platform remains a challenge.
This is because the game industry, which has been lukewarm about securing 5G-related content, can be a catalyst to shift to a more aggressive attitude.
Previously, e-sports games were broadcast through online or game broadcasting channels, but the information that could be transmitted was limited due to the limitation of communication capacity.
4X zoom was possible because 5G broadcasting was able to send higher-quality and high-capacity data than existing 4G long-term evolution mobile communication service (4G LTE).
In response to such public interest, mobile operators have moved fast.
When Cho Sung-joo built a siege tank and built a 2nd expand base, Kim Do-woo won the victory by defeating Terran's troops and construction robots with an immortal-high templar rush.
Storms and ground troops stormed the Terran defense line to claim victory.
After building a number of shield charging stations near the Terran front yard, the storm continued, reducing the Terrans' main force.
Cho Seong-ju succeeded in reconnaissance earlier on and did not suffer much damage.
Cho Sung-joo stood out in the airlift and won the first set.
"In "New Repugnancy", Kim Do-u produced a flickering tracker after the forward gate and hit the Terran's front yard, but he was blocked by Cho Seon-ju's calm response."
Hoata relieves pain by charging the electrical energy required by tissue cells of patients with high-voltage microcurrents from 1,500 to 3,000 volts.
If the membrane potential is reduced to less than 50% (-30 ~ 40mV) of the normal level for a long period of time, chronic fatigue is caused by chronic inflammation and reactive fibrosis.
On the other hand, if the negative potential is charged to the injured or sickly weakened cells to increase the membrane potential, the lymph sludge accumulated around the cell will melt away and the cell metabolism will be revived.
The concept is completely different from conventional physical therapy or Chinese medicine's electroacupuncture that stimulate compression points, where pain occurs when pressed, or acupuncture points with microcurrent.
It is not the kind of "Percutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator" (TENS) commonly found in Korean hospital Rehabilitation Department or Orthopedic Physiotherapy Department.
Just as electric cars do not have power without electricity, our body cells become sick and unable to function properly when they are discharged.
The first round of the solo tournament will kick off on the 13the and 14th, and will be played 10 times until June 16.

It was the first time in 14 years that Manchester United scored 0 shots on goal in the European Football Association (UEFA) Champions League after losing 0-1 to AC Milan in Italy in March 2005.
Naturally, the cover of the bottom area did not come quickly.
Philippe Coutinho came down left and Ivan Rakitic came down the right side to join the defense, but neither are the players have merit in running.
In particular, it seems to have got a lot of hints in the Primera Liga Villarreal match on the 4th when Barcelona had a 4-4 draw.
These circumstances were detected in head coach Solshar's tactics against Barcelona.
He made a general review of the game, saying my personal performance in the midfield was very good. I did my best to play against Messi and kept the balance well."
Barcelona succeeded to catch them off guard several times, thanks to Messi's sharp chip pass, but the attack process was not as sophisticated as usual.
The referee pinpointed a moment that could not be captured by the eye, giving England's Tottenham Hotspur and Spain's FC Barcelona a victory.
The offside flag was pulled out, but the assistant referee had no choice.
The situation was so fast that it was difficult for the assistant referee to make accurate judgments as well.
The Champions League was scheduled to introduce VAR from next season.
Kicker Sergio Aguero failed to score and did not benefit from VAR, but it was an important situation to decide the game.
Fans have been pointing out that the game is poorly operated.
Active front pressure can lead to the opponent’s mistake, but if the first pressure line is broken, they might face a counterattack in a flash.
Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has been caught in criticism.
Manchester City has an average 60.2% ball share and 89.7% pass accuracy in the Champions League this season, including the match against Tottenham.
Statistics show that Tottenham played better than Manchester City.
Son Heung-min's wits caught the eye of soccer fans around the world by recapturing the almost missed ball with an indomitable will and eventually shaking the net.
In the 10th minute of the second half, Kane, the main striker, could no longer play the match because an opponent player stepped on his ankle.
Tottenham's Son Heung-Min scored the winning goal in the first leg of the 2018-2019 Union of European Football Association (UEFA) Champions League quarter-finals between Manchester City and Tottenham at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London, England, on the 10th in Korean time.
Critics say Son Heungmin has made a crisis into an opportunity because It's a goal that comes after Harry Kane, the key striker, was sidelined with an injury.
The referee declared the score after the video was read whether it was offside and whether the ball was off the line.
In the 13th minute of the first half, Man City's Raheem Sterling's shot was hit by the arm of opposing team Danny Rose and declared a penalty with Man City taking the chance first.
President Chung's defeat was not just the election of FIFA council members.
They say that Korea was uncooperative in participating in sponsorships or holding the small conventions.
Chairman Chung filed suspicion that the "Philippine commissioner Araneta received a private plane from Qatar commissioner Almohannadi" on the 5th, five days before the election.
He siad, "I have been doing my best for the past two years, and I am sorry that I can not be elected this time. I will concentrate on domestic football issues for the time being."
The first is that president Chung lost in the political logic of football.
South Korea's football, which had suffered a hard time in the international stages due to chairman Chung's defeat in elections, is likely to face difficulties in the diplomatic process later.
There is also an evaluation that president Chung has not had any tangible results.
It is a big shock considering that "Hyundai House", from the former chairman of Chung Mong-jun, has been in charge of the international soccer field for more than 25 years.
Various analyses are being made on the reasons for the election's crushing defeat.
Saudi Aziz Al Mohannadi (Qatar), Praful Patel (India), Mariano Araneta Jr. (Philippines), Zhao Chai Doo (China) and Dashima Gozo (Japan) received higher votes than president Chung.
It is already a fact that FIFA President Gianni Infantino is even considering expanding his World Cup roster to 48 countries.
Instead, Fernández went to the first base and showed the defension-compliant.
Above all, it was clear that only 68 strikeouts were hit.
The Doosan batter line was so strong that the gap was not felt so much, but there was a view that a large stage such as autumn baseball needed an foreign batter to lead the batter line atmosphere.
Fernandez's strength, among other things, is to show a strong side in chances.
Fernandez's early career is growing hope that Doosan can end the history of great failure of foreign batters it had experienced last year.
Compared to the number of strikeouts by other foreign hitters, including Jeremy Hazelbaker (18, KIA Tigers), Mel Lohas Junior (17, KT Whiz), and Gerard Hoing (16, Hanwha Eagles) the numbers are much different.
Participating teams, schedules, and competition rules were released on the official website.
In China, Oh My God (OMG), 17 Gaming, Crystal Luster, and Four Angry Man survived the "Douyu Golden Legends" (DGL) to gain entry.
"According to the official website of the Facebook It Global Summit, the rules of this tournament are similar to those of the Pubge Korea League (PKL) in Korea."
Korea's OP Gaming Rangers, African Prix Fatal, Team VSG, and OGN Entus Force will compete in the competition.
In North America, Tempo Storm, Cloud Nine, Team Envious, and Shoot to Kill participated in the competition, while Ens eSports, Team Liquid, Ninja in Pajama (NiP) and Win Strike were joined in Europe, Middle East and Africa areas.
According to PUBG Co., Ltd., the premium partner competition, "Face It Global Summit: PUBG Classic" will be held in London, UK, from 16th to 21st.
Daegu Bank gained its own propaganda effect when the public fund market fell down.
The team color of Daegu and Man City is the same as light blue.
"The nearby restaurants of the stadium enjoy unprecedented popularity in the days of home games, and MD shops selling club products are also popular."
Manchester City moved from a mid-low ranked club in the late 2000s to the leading European soccer club beyond England over a decade thanks to its huge money investment.
Daegu and Daegu Bank are enjoying this effect in the K-League this season.
It is to make the soccer field itself a tourist destination.
Cesinha, dubbed "Daeguero" thanks to his looks resembling Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero, expressed gratitude to fans through an interview after the recent match.
The number of viewers per game by Naver TV's live broadcasting service watching Daegu games on its home has increased sharply from 12,423 last year to 33,668 this year.
Fans chanting "Man City" in Daegu also contain their earnest hopes and aspirations to keep up with their success.
With the proper fusion of tourism culture, industry and sports, it became a successful model for local development.
Daegu's propaganda is significant because most local metropolitan teams have not been able to improve the situation of severe deficit structure and the same problem is repeated every year.
Valencia (46 points), Sevilla (46 points), Deportivo Alaves (44 points) and Athletic Bilbao (43 points) are fighting for the goal to enter 4th place.
AC Milan (52 victory points), Atalanta (51 victory points), AS Roma (51 victory points), Torino (49 victory points) and Lazio (48 victory points) dreaming of great house reconstruction are competing.
It's time for the Napoli to win all of the games as the Juventus lost all of its remaining games.
In the next two games, the lead Juventus (84 points) will score 4 points or more, or the Napoli SSC (63 points) that is following will score 4 points or lower.
The team currently ranked fourth in the 31st round is Getafe (47 points) who succeeded third-place Real Madrid (60 points).
It is not until the end of the 38th round that which team will be able to survive in the fourth-place fight that is more intense than the championship.
Seven teams are getting blood clots in one place.
This season is a great time to make up for the failure.
Messi and Ivan Rakitich, who played a lot of games, were excluded from the selection.
"In the 30th round of the match against Villarreal, the situation was captured in the Primera Liga in Estadio de la Serra Mica on the third day of a four-to-four draw."
Malcolm, who plays as a left-side striker with Ousmane Dembele, had only two starts in the Primera Liga this season.
It was an inevitable choice for victory when a tie-goal was needed.
He played 28 out of Barcelona's 30 games in the Primera Liga and played in all matches except for two group qualification match in the Champions League due to his injury.
The reason why Messi has not been incapable of his own strength out of the Champions League tournaments in recent years was also due to his inability to escape from physical strain.
In the 10th minute of the second half, he got the ball that was sharply passed by Eriksen, won a battle against the opponent defender, and scored with an accurate shot.
Son Heung-min of England professional football Tottenham Hotspur played as if he flew.
Looking at Tottenham's losing streak, Eriksen's poor performance was notable.
Records show that Son Heung-min's kicks were especially sharp.
As can be seen from keep in step with Eriksen on the day, this means that the offensive route that was focused on Kane has been distributed to Son Heung-min.
Kim Do-woo went on a rush after adding immortals, but Park Ryeong-woo momentarily destroyed the Protoss forward building.
After Kim Do-woo built a forge, he launched a photon cannon rush on the Zerg Hill, but Park Ryeong-woo blocked it with a calm spine crawler.
Resonant rupture guns were upgraded in the position of catching off zerg's guard.
This was a good picture for the Protoss, but Park Ryung-woo's game turned over.
Park Ryeong-woo was occupied while continuing to produce Drones, because of mistaking it for the containment style Protos.
Five minutes later, Jordan Murch, who came from the English Premier League (EPL), scored the K-League debut in the blinds of the goal side, and in the extra two minutes Bae Gi jong made the tie goal and avoided the defeat.
"Gyeongnam had three goals in a matchup against Jeonbuk Hyundai, a defending champion on the 2nd, but they made a draw by showing off the last minute."
The team's first win of the season was reported when, in the third round against Suwon Samsung, Cho Seong-jun scored with a powerful right-footed mid-range shot in the 1-1 situation at stoppage time of the second half.
"Of the 66 goals made in the K League 1 as of the 2nd, 14 (21 percent) were scored after 35 minutes in the second half, about 10 minutes before the end of the game."
Sangju Sangmu captain, Kim Min-woo, also scored a wedge goal in the 37 minutes against Incheon last month on the 16th, leading the team to a 2-0 victory.
K-League Gyeongnam FC was meted out a fine of KRW 20 million for violating the rules of The Korea Professional Football League banning political activities inside the stadium.
Representative Hwang and Candidate Kang, wearing the red jumpers with Liberty Korea Party’s name printed on them, appealed for support from the soccer fans in the stands.
The Punishment Committee decided that Gyeongnam FC, which failed to properly control representative Hwang's party campaign, violated the rules of a professional federation that banned political activities on the stadium.
The committee was held for four hours starting from 10 a.m. with the disciplinary committee members including Chairman Cho Nam-don, Heo Jung-moo (vice-president of the Federation), Oh Se-kwon (Disciplinary Committee of Korea Football Association), Young-gil Yoon (Professor of Korea National Sports University), Hong Eun-a (Professor of Ewha Womans University), and Kim Ga-ram (lawyer).
At that time, Kang Ki-yoon, a candidate for a parliamentary seat in Seongsan-gu, Changwon, a party member like Hwang Kyo-ahn of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, entered the stadium's stands for the campaign ahead of the parliamentary by-election on 3th.
"The team members asked him to "take off the jumper with the party order," but Hwang was the only one who took off while others did not."
Before the committee of reward and punishment's meeting, Gyeongnam FC even submitted a prima facie evidence to the federation, saying, "When officials from the Liberty Korea Party, including Hwang, entered, we explained to them the "not to be brought in" rules on clothes marked with party names, symbols, and candidate names, but to no avail."
With the punishment decided by the committee of reward and punishment, the club is expected to hold the Liberty Korea Party and Kang legally responsible, including seeking damages.
There have been various changes not only in selection but also in terms of replacement.
Marcelo, Sergio Ramos, Nacho Fernandez, and Santiago Odriozola were placed in the back four, and Daniel Ceballos, Marcos Llorente, and Isco lined up in the midfield.
Real Madrid came from behind and won three to two in the 2018-19 Spanish Primera Liga Round 29 against Huesca held at Santiago Bernabéu, Madrid, Spain on the 1st.
It is analyzed that head coach Zidane is planning the next season in earnest.
The fact that there has been a big change in the range of players can be seen by looking at the game against Celta Vigo on the 12th of last month, when Zidane was returning to the team.
Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, who were the core of the midfield, did not compete.
Kiwoom, KIA, and Lotte are the fewest with four team home runs.
In total, Doosan is stable among the top three candidate the at 3.08 for the average ERA for pitchers, but the batting ability remains at 0.246 and needs to be improved.
The SK Wyverns, last year's Korean Series winners, and the Doosan Bears, the top regular season team, are also ahead and showing off their strength.
In terms of pitching power, LG has the best score with an average ERA of 2.43.
"KT Wiz, who finished 9th last year for the third consecutive year, has a bad start with 2 wins and 6 losses this year."
On the contrary, LG has the lowest batting average of 0.210.
On the contrary, Lotte was the worst with a 6.31 ERA.
Candidate Kang's jumper included his name and election symbol.
"The suspicion that former director Ahn Jong-bok bought referees in 2015 was confirmed to be true, and the team was slapped with a heavy penalty of a 10-point cut for the first time since the league's establishment."
Hong, who was the owner of the team at the time, also mentioned on his SNS account the possibility of disbanding the team, saying, "If we fall into the second division, we can hardly manage the team."
If Gyeongnam FC is found to be guilty in the process of Hwang’s stumping, it will face disciplinary measures such as 10 or more points deduction, a home game without an audience, or a fine of 20 million won.
He won the K League 2 title in 2017, was promoted and won the runner-up K League 1 in 2018, but problems broke out from the outside.
Both the chairman of the Liberty Korea Party Hwang Gyo-an and the candidate of the same party Kang Gi-yun visited the stand of Gyeongnam Changwon Football Center on the 30th, when the fourth K-League Rounds of Gyeongnam FC and Daegu FC were held.
"Gyeongnam FC again fell victim to the political arena as the main opposition Liberty Korea Party staged an in-house campaign for the April 3 by-election following the arrest of Kim Kyung-soo, governor of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea, on charges of manipulating Druking's comments."
Governor Kim Kyung-soo was arraigned for manipulating Drukking comments.
Both jumpers were written with the Korean Party name.
As the tactics changed in the second half game, Harry Kane showed a bit of his capability, but his overall performance wasn't enough for his reputation.
Liverpool had many substitutes who could change the flow of the game, such as Fabinho, Adam Lalana, and Gerdan Shakiri, while Tottenham had only Son Heung-min's tactical card.
The Tottenham Hotspurs were defeated 1-2 by Liverpool in the 2018-2019 English Premier League match in Anfield, Liverpool, England on the 31st (local time).
Although Danny Rose pulled off his best performance in the last 5 games, it could be seen that his strength died down as he entered the second half of the game.
The reason was that the players played for the national team, but it was not as close as the league schedule.
On the PGA Tour, “Big Rookie” Lim Sung-jae (21), who was aiming for two rabbits, his first debut win and the first major tournament of the season, the Masters, failed to achieve his goal.
While Park In-bee lost one shot with two bogeys and one birdie in the first half due to putting confusion, Hataoka had three birdies alone and took the lead.
At the final round of the Kia Classic, the LPGA Tour held at Aviara Golf Club (par 72, 6,609 yards) in Carlsbad, California, on the1st (Korea time), Park In-bee reduced her shots by three birdies and two bogeys.
If Park In-bee had won this tournament, she would have been the second Korean to reach the 20-win mark on the LPGA Tour after Pak Se-ri, 42 (25 wins).
On the other hand, Ko Jin-young (24), who tied for second place with Park In-bee, was delighted to win the total prize money and become the top player in the Player of the Year category.
"After being promoted to the first division, he only played 15 minutes as a substitute against Scotland in the UEFA Europa League 32 match on the 22nd."
Osasuna and Granada, who are likely to be promoted in the next season's Segunda Liga (second division), and Deportivo Alavés, who is in the top five of Primera Liga this season, are interested in signing Lee Gang-in.
In other words, Coach Marcelino García Toral has no reason to call Lee Kang-in, who has gone through long-distance flights and jet lag adaptations at a time when there are enough alternatives.
It also shows an analysis that the team schedule would have become poison.
Coach Marcelino responded with the intention that it would be difficult to give a chance to Lee Gang-in in the press conference last month before the Primera Liga match.
In fact, Valencia had 40 points with 10 games remaining until the end of the season, ranking seventh in the Primera Liga.
This is because the scope of the tactical operation has been narrowed with the occurrence of the injured.
With the starting resources exhausted, the replacement card is not appropriate.
In other words, the appointment of players will be restricted.
For Tottenham, which has lacking players, break is same as oasis in desert.
That's why Tottenham's overall scoring has dropped significantly this month.
Not only Dier, but Danny Rose, Kieran Trippier, Dele Alli and Harry Kane have returned after being drafted to the England squad.
Since there isn't enough players in the team, their departure is damaging.
Son Heung-min is also worried about the sickness from the fatigue of travel due to long-distance flights between London and Korea.
This is why the three-back system is expected rather than the recently used four-back system.
Rose and Trippier should continue their active side attack by quickly overlapping in an attack, but their movements were limited as they failed to shake off pressure from the other side.
Most of the main players have been to the national team for the A-match.
Losing the ability to dominate the midfield results in paralysis throughout the entire aggressive flow.
Allowing multiple shots to James is a straighforward example.
"With a 2-1 lead, replacing exhausted Jung Woo-young was also a valid option if he had the capacity to deploy Kwon Kyung-won to switch to a five-back and opt for stability and practicality instead of adventure."
Kim Mun-hwan, the right fullback who started against Colombia, was even scolded for making a back pass to Cho Hyeon-u without seeing Hwang In-beom in front.
This is why Jung Woo-young was physically exhausted in the second half.
As the ball was not put into the center of the opponent's narrow dense defense, the attack route was concentrated by the cross of both sides’ fullbacks.
If he wanted to regain his mid-range grip, he could play a more comfortable midfielder and had a defensive sense of stability.
It can also ease the problem of front-line strikers being isolated.
This is because they joined the midfield and did not have to pressure them on defense.
If there were no sharp mid-range shot of Lee Jae-sung at the 12th minute of the second half, and Cho Hyeon-woo’s good defense, it would not have been strange even if the result of the match was reversed.
Park Chan-ho started against the Milwaukee Brewers in April 2001 when he was with the Los Angeles Dodgers and became a winning pitcher after allowing one run in seven innings.
Ryu Hyun-jin and Kang Jung-ho played an active role in Tuta, but there were also players left a feeling of rejection.
Ryu Hyun-jin was the most impressive player among the Korean Major Leaguers in the Major League's opening game held in various regions of the U.S. on the 29th.
Ryu Hyun-jin started the opening game against the Arizona Diamonds at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles and became a winning pitcher in six innings, four hits, striking out eight and allowing one run, including one homer.
"Instead of Clayton Kershaw, who was in charge of starting the LA Dodgers opener for the eighth consecutive year, Ryu Hyun-jin, who was on the mound, completely covered the empty space of Kershaw."
In the opening game of the U.S. Major League Baseball, Korean players had mingled feelings of joy and sorrow.
At bat, Kang Jung-ho, who returned to the Major League, showed off his power following his exhibition game.
Manager Lee said, “Park encourages other players to run drinks and "let's prey together", before practicing twice a week.”
Manager Lee said, "In order to improve the performance, it is necessary to use the personal equipment that you are familiar with at the competition, but it cannot be used immediately because the price is 700,000 won."
I asked Dohun what he needed most now.
Mr. Park said, “I can see Do-hoon, who was not very talkative because of his shy personality, became active after he started exercising.
When the story of the Paralympics came out, Do-hoon, who had rarely said anything, opened his mouth.
The question is how much players are ready to enjoy the game?
I want everyone to be a starting point to enjoy the game.
He/she has no experience of playing in youth, academy sports, or his/her team, so he/she cannot make a sudden difference in the national team.
Excessive criticism, especially when the result or content is not as expected, shakes players and managers, and ultimately makes them unable to enjoy the game.
"I loved basketball very much when I was young, but after I felt responsible, I never thought 'I should Enjoy Basketball.'" he said.
Seo Jang-hoon's words were quite sensational, and the post that captured the video is still noticeable on the Internet.
However, as a result of his career as a player and as a leader in many countries, I think the most important difference found in Korean athletes was first noticeable.
Roger Federer's comments that "It is important to play healthy and fun." even after losing the BNP Paribas Open final not too long ago have nothing to do with being the Tennis Emperor who has won 100 games.
The ball often stays in the center when it is a fierce midfield battle or when one side leads the game dominantly but fails to make a deadly pass.
It should provide a sharp forward pass from central midfield, and its 2nd line resources had to disrupt the opposing defense line, which Hwang In-beom, Jung Woo-young and Koo Ja-cheol failed to carry out any such duties.
In the end, the Korean national team won the game with only one goal in the middle, but they were struck at the game with Qatar team.
Korean football has begun to recover positively after defeating Bolivia and Colombia in a row.
This is the percentage of the ball stayed in the central area.
It asserts that Hanwha broke the common law, "Do not provoke the opponent" first, thus leading to a situation that Coach Kim could not keep still.
In particular, the fact that the head coach Kim had such a similar career seven years ago when he was in LG Twins Command Tower, fueled the anger of fans.
On the mound, Joe Wieland won his first Korean debut with good pitch of six innings and seven hits (including one home run), four walks on ball, three strikeouts and three runs (two earned runs).
At the first base of no out, Hazel Baker raided the first two-run hit, and Kim Min-sik hit to call two runners home.
Coach Kim has been once reprimanded for replacing the last batter with rookie pitcher Shin Dong-hoon in the ninth inning when SK coach Lee Man-soo made two pitchers replacements in the ninth inning, which also fell 0-3 against the SK Wyverns in Jamsil on Sept. 12, 2012.
On the previous day Hanwha manager Han Yong-deok, he let finisher Jung Woo-ram on the mound after two out in the bottom of 9th inning in the big winning situation, and angry KIA manager Kim Ki-tae made the pitcher Moon Kyung-chan a pinch-hitter.
Chris Sale of the Boston Red Sox (five years, $145 million) and Paul Goldschmidt of the St. Louis Cardinals (five years, $130 million) also hit "jackpot" before the FA.
In addition to Andy Warhol's ‘Flower’ of millions of dollars which appeared as the best of the year, works of important artists in contemporary art history such as German neo-expressionist Georg Baselitz, British artist Damien Hirst, Chinese avant-garde artist Zengpanz, were assembled.
Richard Nagy Gallery, based in London, the UK, has set up a special exhibit booth with about 40 pieces of drawing and paintings by Egon Schiller, which is difficult to proceed even for the leading art galleries.
This is because players can't refuse the team's offers if they don't have "Qualification for a Salary Adjustment" which can get only after three years of full-time.
Mike Trout (LA Angels) has agreed to an extension of the record US$430 million in U.S. professional sports for 12 years, while the Colorado Rockies held Nolan Arenado for $260 million over eight years.
The art marketplace has been on the rise since the establishment in Hong Kong for the Asian art market by the world's top art fair, Swiss Art Basel, but it shows the lack of good news this year.
"Blake Snell, last year's American League Cy Young Award winner who made his debut in 2016 but played full-time for two years starting in 2017, received an annual salary increase of just $15,500 on the 10th of last month, but he had to accept the offer."
DeGrom said even before the contract that he wanted to "play for the Mets for a long time," while Trout stressed after the contract that he had "no intention of leaving."
POSCO E & C participated as a construction investor of Uijeongbu Rhythm City Co., Ltd., which is a developer of the project this month, and by 2022, it will develop site development projects such as roads, parks, and green areas and apartment houses in the complex.
In the case of expulsion, it is said that if the team is only neglected in the management and supervision work, or if the team's employees have systematically intervened and made serious misconduct.
Section 1 contains the sanction clause in cases where executives and staff members of the club intervene in cheating or where the cheating is deemed to have occurred negligently by the club's obligation of management and supervision.
Article 149 Paragraph 3 of the reporting obligations requires that the club must immediately report the fact to the president if it becomes aware of it.
Article 148 The term "misconduct" states that appropriate sanctions may be imposed if a player, a manager, a coach, a member of the team, or a member of the referee misconduct as individually or jointly.
The sanctions have been tightened, but there are no items for the club's employees.
There are operation and use of illegal sports betting in A.
In the case of employees concerned, it is possible to suspend their duties or impose sanctions.
Although the stage has changed, the record cannot be ignored.
Korea has met Iran that Queiroz leads five times.
This is the story when Queiroz was the coach of Iran's national team.
Manager Queiroz ,also has a special relationship with manager Bento.
That's why you can be confident of winning, even though it includes top strikers from major European clubs such as James Rodriguez (Bayern Munich) and Radamel Falcao (AS Monaco).
We need to recreate the good memories against Colombia.
Doc Rivers, head coach of the home team Clippers, suddenly grabbed the microphone.
However, if the interviews so far are combined, it seems that the atmosphere of nurturing young players and resentments for not recognizing the value of senior players have been mixed.
Lee Dong-guk (Jeonbuk Hyundai), a soccer star in his forties, has been running double-digit scores every season from 2013, when he was 34 years old, until last year.
Obviously, his age is past its peak as a player, but depending on his efforts, he can turn it into an opportunity of reversal anyway.
If only he managed his strength properly, there was a plenty of possibilities that Lee Yong-gyu would be a good veteran.
My love and pride in baseball is more important than any record.
In his book, "The Courage to Be Disliked 2", Kishimi Ichiro said, "The value of human beings is determined not by what kind of work they engage in, but by what attitude they take in the work."
In order to secure future competitiveness, teams investing in young players is a phenomenon that appears in all sports as well as baseball.
It was after the lead and the flow of attacks were completely over to the opponent.
Outstanding Colombian side strikers such as Luis Diaz and Luis Muriel aimed for a cross after beating left and right fullbacks based on their individual skills.
The Colombian offense team with their excellent individual skills released 18 shots (7 shots on target), but only one shot was successful.
If you only consider how the team played in the match, Colombia surely deserved to win.
Due to Bento's strong trust toward Kim Seung-gyu, Cho Hyun-woo could not step on the ground even for a minute at the 2019 United Arab Emirates Asian Cup.
However, as Carlos Queiroz Colombia's manager is more likely to put weight on the back, it is expected to maintain the attack stance.
At a time when they are having trouble securing a spot at FC Tokyo in Japan's J-League, if they fail to catch the chance when they are given, they will be forced to lose out in-competition.
As Colombian midfielders have excellent individual skills, chances are high that they will use professional midfielders with a sense of security rather than Na Sang-ho.
The hot competition of Na-Ho and the newcomers who chase him began.
Na-hu needs to be a little bit more upset.
Veteran resources such as Lee Chung-yong and Lee Jae-sung are on standby, including Lee Seung-woo's first starter selection, who played an impressive game against Bolivia.
Unlike other formations, the left-wing midfielder, where Na Sang-ho is located, doesn't yet have a solid player tapped by Bento.
It is the fiercest position in the absence of an unrivaled player and most likely to change tactics.
There are plenty of candidates from Kwon Chang-hoon, who returned to the national team in a year, to those who scored against Bolivia such as Lee Chung-yong, Lee Jae-sung, Hwang In-beom and Lee Seung-woo.
"We will maintain our old form of play," Bento said on the 25th, but added, "We have yet to decide whether to include young players or veterans."
"Because there are not many outstanding strikers, it seems to have tested alternatives," said KBSN commentator Kim Dae-gil, "It's not a bad attempt in terms of increasing tactical diversity."
There is no suitable substitute as it is given a heavy duty to distribute the ball, control the tempo, and run the game as a whole.
While there are not enough strikers to close the scoring in front of the opponent's goal line and a group of defensive midfielder candidates to coordinate the match in the midfield, there is plenty of second-term resources to unlock the clues to the offense.
It helps players improve their lives as well as their paychecks.
I'll tell him that I can show him at any time in a way that the team doesn't break down.
Among the many cultures enjoyed by young people, e-Sports was very hot and confirmed the possibility of further development.
It was important to penetrate the culture of young people in their teens and 20s to expand the financial activities that were centered on older generations to younger generation.
Music and fashion have entry barriers within the industry.
Even if there were some failures, he/she decided to build a team so that they could gain confidence through a bold game style and feel pride as a member of Hanwha Life.
Lee Seung-woo has been replaced after 40 minutes late in the second half of the game on the Bento's team.
A team who played a better match may not win.
It was a shot that energizes the team in situations where it needed to score.
Things were not easy until just before Lee Cheong-yong's header goal at 41 minutes in the second half.
It is expected that this was what head coach Bento expected from Lee Seung-woo.
He seemed confident as he settled down in Hellas Verona, Italy.
After the game he did not hide his desire to run more.
In his movements, Lee Seung-woo's unique desire was clearly revealed.
Even though he overwhelmed the game with a perfect share, it was a shame to finish in a critical situation. Even though he dominated the game by taking a perfect share, it was regrettable that he had to wrap it up in critical situations.
The problem occurred after the opponent approached Lim Eun-su, who was almost stuck on the link wall, but the opponent continued practice as if nothing happened.
As the controversy ensued, the figure skater, including Mariah Bell's boyfriend and an American teammate, countered that "It was a rumor that it was intentional."
An American squad official explained that there was no intention, and then told Mariah Bell's intention, "I want to apologize for the one I couldn't do because of training music."
A video clip of the collision between the two was released on the Internet, which raised public doubts about their intentions.
Although the picture quality was low after being filmed in the stands, the scene showed Lim holding onto the leg after Mariah Bell approached Lim Eun-soo, who was glued to the link side.
In particular, management company All That Sports' official who witnessed the scene argued that the opponent punched deliberately, ignited a controversy.
Captain Son Heung-min, Lee Cheung-yong, Lee Jae-sung, Kwon Chang-hoon, Lee Seung-woo, Hwang Hee-chan, Na Sang-ho, Hwang In-bum and Baek Seung-ho can come out.
It remains to be seen what choice head coach Bento will make regarding Lee Kang-in.
In other words, he made a subtle appeal to head coach Bento for his position.
Cho Hyun-woo and Lee Seung-woo, who performed superbly at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia and the Jakarta-Palembang Asian Games, were also not as sure as they did at Bento's side.
This is why Lee's A-match is important this month.
This is why it is expected that it will be difficult for Lee Kang-in to start.
The first is to reveal the potential during the training process.
